To fully understand the VideoLAN solution, you must
understand the difference between a <emphasis>codec</emphasis> and a
<emphasis>container format</emphasis>
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
A <emphasis>codec</emphasis> is a compression
algorithm, used to reduce the size of a stream. There are audio codecs
and video codecs. MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Vorbis, DivX, ... are
codecs
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
A <emphasis>container format</emphasis> contains
one or several streams already encoded by codecs. Very often, there
is an audio stream and a video one. AVI, Ogg, MOV, ASF, ... are
container formats. The streams contained can be encoded using different
codecs. In a perfect world, you could put any codec in any container
format. Unfortunately, there are some incompatibilities. You can
find a matrix of possible codecs and container formats on the <ulink

<para>
To decode a stream, VLC first
<emphasis>demuxes</emphasis> it. This means that it reads the container
format and separates audio, video, and subtitles, if any. Then, each of
these are passed <emphasis>decoders</emphasis> that do the mathematical
processing to decompress the streams

<para>
There is a particular thing about MPEG:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
MPEG is a <emphasis>codec</emphasis>. There are
several versions of it, called MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, ...
</para></listitem>

<listitem>

<para>MPEG is also a container format, sometimes refered
to as <emphasis>MPEG System</emphasis>. There are several types of MPEG:
ES, PS, and TS</para>
<para>When you play an MPEG video from a DVD, for instance, the MPEG
stream is actually composed of several streams (called Elementary
Streams, ES): there is one stream for video, one for audio, another for
subtitles, and so on. These different streams are mixed together into a
single Program Stream (PS). So, the .VOB files you can find in a DVD are
actually MPEG-PS files. But this PS format is not adapted for streaming
video through a network or by satellite, for instance. So, another
format called Transport Stream (TS) was designed for streaming MPEG
videos through such channels.</para>
