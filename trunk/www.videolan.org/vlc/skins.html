<p>VLC has now a skinnable interface. It's only available on Windows
systems and is experimental. That means it should work on Windows 2000
and has not yet been tested on Win9x/WinXP OS.</p>
<p>Actually we are working on a GTK version so that this feature will be
soon available on Linux platforms.</p>

<? h2("How to get it ?"); ?>

<p>You can test the skinnable interface in the 
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html">0.5.3
release</a>. There is a shortcut in the start menu can launch this
interface.</p>

<p>Or you can launch it with command line:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 50px;">

</pre>

<p>Or go to the preference menu after launching the client and ckick on
the <b>View/Add Interface/skins</b> menu.</p>

are just testing skins but if you think you're some kind of artist, you
don't need any programming skills so here is
