<answer>

<para>
Where did you read VLC for Mac OS 9 exist? There is
not, and will not be, a version for Mac OS 9.
</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>
Does VLC support DVDs from all regions?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Well this mostly depends on your DVD drive. Testing it is usually
the quickest way to find out. The problem is that a lot of newer drives
are RPC2 drives these days. Some of these drives don't allow raw access
to the drive untill the drive firmware has done a regioncheck. VLC uses
<emphasis>libdvdcss</emphasis> and it needs raw access to the DVD drive
to crack the encryption key. So with these drives it is impossible to
circumvent the region protection. (This goes for all software. You will
need to flash your drives firmware, but sometimes there is no alternate
firmware available for your drive). On other RPC2 drives that DO allow raw
access, it might take VLC a <emphasis>long</emphasis> time to crack the key.
So just pop the disc in your drive and try it out, while you get a coffee.
RPC1 drives should 'always' work regardless of the regioncode.
</para>

<qandaentry><question><para>
Where does VLC store its config file?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Currently, a config file is created on a per
user basis (there is no global configuration file). If you modify
the available options in VLC and save the new configuration, then
a configuration file will be created in your user directory. The
precise location of this file depends on the Operating System you are
running:
</para>

<qandaentry><question><para>
VLC has a strange behavior...
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
The first thing to do is to reset the VLC preferences in the preferences
dialog of the application and restart VLC. If VLC doesn't even start anymore, delete VLC's
configuration file (see the previous question to know about its
location). Then restart VLC. If it does not get any better, read the
following questions!

<qandaentry><question><para>
I cannot read DVDs!
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Here are a few things to check:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>

If you are on Linux, did you install the <emphasis>libdvdcss</emphasis>
package?

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

Do you have write access to your DVD device? For
instance, under Unix:

</para>

<screen>
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>chmod 666 /dev/dvd</userinput>
</screen>

<para>

where <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> is the device
corresponding to your DVD drive.

</para>

</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>
The video runs but the picture is distorted
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
There is probably a problem with the output layer.
There are several ways of troubleshooting it. First, try with another
output plugin, for instance:
</para>

<screen>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc -V sdl</userinput>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc -V x11</userinput>
</screen>

<para>
Second, change your screen depth and/or definition.
It quite often helps. Lastly, if running Unix, have a look at your
XFree86 video driver.
</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>
Video is choppy
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Your system might be too slow to decode all pictures. It
might be that your CPU basically is not fast enough. It can also be that
the subsystem is misconfigured/misdriven, this happens for example under
Redhat Linux. Here are some elements to improve speed:

Audio and video are out of sync
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Try using another audio output plugin and, under
Unix, kill <emphasis>esd</emphasis> or <emphasis>artsd</emphasis> if

</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Are you sure VLC supports the file? Try checking the <ulink

VideoLAN streaming solution
</title>

<qandaentry><question><para>
Do I need a "streaming server"?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>

Well, there are in fact two kinds of streaming: passive streaming in which
a movie is sent by a server and watched by one or several client, and
Video On Demand (VOD) in which each client asks for its own stream.
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>

In passive streaming, the client has no control upon the server, and
must subscribe for instance to a multicast group to receive the stream.
This kind of streaming needs a server able to send data on a network
with a protocol such as UDP multicast or RTP, for instance VLS or
VLC stream output. The client side needs a player supporting such
protocols, as VLC does.

</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>

In Video On Demand, no specific "streaming server" is required, but the 
client must be able to read the stream in real time, instead of just
dowloading the whole video before one can start viewing it. A simple
protocol such as HTTP is sufficient for Video On Demand, so you just 
have to put your movie on a web server, and use a clever player to
view it in real time, VLC for instance ;-) However of course you
will not be able to view movies in real time if your network is too slow,
so you MUST check that the average bandwith of your network link is
higher than the average bandwith of your movie (size / duration).
If it is not the case, VLC will try to keep in real time as much as
possible, so you will probably get only the audio track and no video.

</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>
VLC vs. VLS
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
Yes, both programs can be
used to stream video, as explained in the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/">VideoLAN
HOWTO</ulink>. The streaming features of
each program are described on the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/streaming/features.html">streaming
features</ulink> page.

</para>

<para>
Technically, there is an important difference:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
VLC opens all the system layers of the input
stream, regenerate them all and then stream the result
on the network or write it to a file. So VLC is good at streaming
untrusted video and/or audio sources, like the video files found on the
Internet and/or produced by non-professionnal software. VLC implements many
muxers/demuxers (ps, ts, avi, ogg, mp4, ...) and many codecs, which
allows to convert encapsulation formats and/or transcode an input stream
on-the-fly ! VLC also has nice graphical interfaces.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
VLS only opens the highest system layers of the
input stream and only has PS and TS demuxers. So VLS is good at
streaming from trusted video and/or audio sources in PS or TS format
produced by professional software or hardware like DVDs and DVB channels
(satellite or digital terrestial TV) because it only regenerate the
system layers that need to be regenerated, and no more. VLS is specially
well designed to stream multiplexed TS streams, for instance a whole DVB
transponder. VLS only has a TS muxer, doesn't do transcoding and doesn't
have graphical interfaces.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>



<qandaentry><question><para>
Is it not a waste of time to develop both?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
To understand this situation, you must consider
the history of VideoLAN. Before VLC's stream output, we had two very
different programs:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
VLS, a program written in C++ running under Linux, Mac OS X
and Windows only, that is basically a MPEG Transport Stream engine, with
a very basic telnet interface, which was used as a server;
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
VLC, a multi-platform program written in C, that
implements demuxers, codecs, video and audio outputs and graphical
interfaces, which was used as a client only.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
In september 2002, some VLC developers had the idea
of taking advantage of the multiple demuxers and codecs implemented in
VLC to build a Stream Output whose ultimate goal was to be able to do
transcoding. They wrote a stream output for VLC, that was released with
VLC 0.5.0 in late January 2003. Introduced with the 0.8.0 release, VLC is able to transcode to any format it can read. Furthermore, starting with the 0.7.x series, VLC is able to stream multiple sources with one instance. This can be controlled with the VideoLAN (Media) Manager (VLM), which can be accessed through the telnet interface only. The http interface will be supported in future releases.
</para>

<para>
But what is more important is that VLS and VLC
developers are not the same people, and that they are free to
write the software they prefer! That is how free software runs,
and it has shown in the past that is was a good engine for innovation
and enhancement.

<qandaentry><question><para>
May I redistribute a piece of VideoLAN software?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
You may distribute an original or modified version of a
piece of VideoLAN software as long as you comply with its license terms. It
is the GNU General Public License Version 2 (referred herein as GPL),
and it is in the file named COPYING in our products. The easiest way to
conform to the GPL is to accompany the product you want to distribute
with its sources. For example, if you plan to distribute the lastest
binary version of VLC, you should also include all the files listed on
the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html">VLC
source code page</ulink>. You do not need to bother explaining where the
sources are, but the sources have to share the same media as the
products. There are other ways to comply with the GPL, but this should
be the simplest because it does not rely on a contract.

You do not need to ask the VideoLAN team the
permission to do so!

<qandaentry><question><para>
Is libdvdcss legal?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>
The use and distribution of the libdvdcss library
is controversial in a few countries such as the United States because
of a law called the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act). If you are
unsure about the legality of using and distributing this library in your
country, please consult your lawyer.

</para>

<note><para>
Beware: VLC media player binaries are distributed with the libdvdcss library included.
</para></note>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>
What about personal/commercial usage?
</para></question>

<answer>

<para>

Some of the codecs distributed with VLC are patented and require you 
to pay royalties to their licensors. These are mostly the MPEG style codecs.

</para>

<para>

With many products the producer pays the license body (in this case <ulink
url="http://www.mpegla.com">MPEG LA</ulink>) so the user (commercial or
personal) does not have to take care of this. VLC (and ffmpeg and libmpeg2
which it uses in most of these cases) cannot do this because they are Free
and Open Source implementations of these codecs. The software is not sold and
therefore the end-user becomes responsible for complying to the licensing and
royalty requirements. You will need to contact the licensor on how to comply
to these licenses.

</para>

<para>

This goes for playing a DVD with VLC for your personal joy ($2.50 one time payment to MPEG LA) as well as for using VLC for streaming a live event in MPEG-4 over the Internet.
