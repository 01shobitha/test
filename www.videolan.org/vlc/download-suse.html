<h1>VLC media player for SUSE Linux x86</h1>
<h2>Looking for SUSE package maintainer</h2>

<p>We currently do not have an official VLC media player package for SUSE. This is because we have no SUSE maintainer. A package could easily be created if someone offered to invest some time into this. Please contact the <a href="mailto:vlc-devel@videolan.org">mailinglist</a> if you would like to port our Mandrake and Redhat/Fedora spec file to the SUSE distribution.

In the mean time, you could try this unofficial and by VideoLAN unsupported SuSE rpm:<br />
