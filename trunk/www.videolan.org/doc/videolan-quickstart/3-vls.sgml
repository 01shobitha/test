<sect2><title>Unicast to a VLC</title>

<sect3><title></title>

<para>You are going to send the stream to a client with vlc installed. In this example, you will unicast from vls (IP address 10.0.0.1) to vlc (IP address 10.0.0.2).</para>

<para>There are two ways to have a VideoLAN Server working: you can use its configuration file <filename>vls.cfg</filename>, and manage it through an administration interface (Telnet or Web, for example), or you can use command line arguments</para>

<para>In this QuickStart, we will only talk about controlling the VideoLAN Server through its command line. For more informations, please read the VideoLAN HOWTO</para>

<para>If you want  to read a DVD,  First, make sure that  you have write
access to  the device  corresponding to  your DVD  drive. </para>

<para>For that,  under Linux you  should be in  the disk or  cdrom group
(look at the permissions in /dev).</para>

<para>As root, do :</para>

<screen><prompt>#</prompt><userinput> adduser my_login disk_or_cdrom</userinput></screen>

<para>and then close your user session and open it again.</para>

<para>If you  are under  Windows 2000 or  XP, you need  to need  to have
administrator rights on the system.</para>

   <title>Start the VideoLAN Server</title>
   <para>The syntax you have to use is</para>
   <screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vls [options] target</userinput></screen>
   <para>Target is the place where the stream you want to see is stored</para>
   <para>It looks like: <filename>file:path_to_your_file</filename> or <filename>dvd:path_to_your_drive</filename></para>
   <para>You will have to use the <filename> -d</filename> (destination) option. In our example, it would be <filename>udp:10.0.0.2</filename></para>
   <para>Your command line could be this under Windows</para>
   <screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vls -d udp:10.0.0.2 file:C:\movies\my_movie.mpg</userinput></screen>
   <para>or this under Linux</para>
   <screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vls -d udp:10.0.0.2 file:/mnt/films/my_movie.mpg</userinput></screen>
  </sect3>
  <sect3><title>Open the stream with the VideoLAN Client</title>
   <para>On the client, run the VLC.</para>
   <para>If you use the command line interface, type</para>
   <screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc udp:</userinput></screen>
   <para>Or, in the graphical interface, click on Net and select UDP</para>

  <title>Broadcast to several VLC's</title>
<para>Broadcasting means  sending the stream  to all the  computers that
are on you subnet. Please note that every computers will get the stream,
even if you aren't using VideoLAN on them.</para>
  <para>To  broadcast with  the  VideoLAN Server,  simply  replace the  IP
address  (for example  10.0.0.2) on  the command  line by  the broadcast
address of your subnet (for example, 10.255.255.255).</para>
 </sect2>
 <sect2><title>Multicast to several VLC's</title>

<sect3><title>What is multicast ?</title>

<para>Multicasting is a more complex way to send streams to several VLC's.  Please note that your network hardware must support Multicast forwarding in order to use these functions</para>

<para>With  this  technology,  the  VideoLAN Server  streams  to  an  IP
address, which is  the address of the "Multicast group".  When you start
the VideoLAN  Client, it  requests its subscription  to this  group, and
then begins to receive the stream. When the VLC quits, he sends a "Leave
Group" request.  By using this, only  the computers that really  need it
get the streaming, but the VideoLAN Server only sends it once</para>

</sect3>

<sect3><title>Set up the VideoLAN Server</title>
<para>To use multicasting, simply replace the IP address by a valid multicast IP address (they start with 238.X.X.X or 239.X.X.X). The VideoLAN Server will automatically detect that you want to multicast.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3><title>Set up the VideoLAN Client</title>

<para>On the VLC, you must choose, in the Net dialog, the UDP Multicast option and enter the address of the multicast group.</para>

<para>If you use the command line, enter:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc udp:IP_Address</userinput></screen>

<para>If you want to avoid to type the IP Address, you must use the VideoLAN Channel Server. Please see the next chapter</para>
