<sect1><title>What is the VideoLAN project ?</title>

<para>

VideoLAN is a complete software solution for video streaming, developed
by students at the <ulink url="http://www.ecp.fr">Ecole Centrale
Paris</ulink> and developers from all over the world, under the <ulink
url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License
(GPL)</ulink>. It has been designed for streaming of MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 videos on
local area networks (LAN), but it can be extended to metropolitan or
wide area networks (MAN, WAN), thanks to the multicast technology.

</para>

<para>

The VideoLAN solution includes a server, which can stream video from
various sources (file, DVD, satellite and MPEG 2 encoder), a client, which can
receive, decode and display MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 streams and, if necessary,
a channel server which automatically tells to the client the parameters
needed to receive the stream.

</para>

<para>

Here is an illustration of the complete VideoLAN solution :

<sect1><title>The documentation of the project</title>

<para>

There are three main documents :

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/videolan-quickstart/">VideoLAN
Quickstart</ulink>. This document will give you a quick overview of the VideoLAN solution. It will learn you basic use of the client, the server, the channel server, and the Video On Demand system.</para>

<listitem><para>the <ulink

HOWTO</ulink>. This document is the complete guide of the VideoLAN Solution. It will give you the complete documentation for the VideoLAN Server, the VideoLAN Channel Server, and the different tools.</para>

<listitem><para>the <ulink

<simplesect><title>VideoLAN Client</title>

<para>

The VideoLAN Client (vlc) works on many platforms : Linux, Windows, Mac
OS X, BeOS, *BSD, Solaris, iPaq, QNX. It can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and
MPEG 4 / DivX files from a hard disk or a CD-ROM drive, read DVDs and
VCDs and read from a satellite card. But the most important function
is that it can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVDs streamed over a network. Vlc
requires at least a Pentium 400Mhz with 32MB of RAM.

</para>

<simplesect><title>VideoLAN Server</title>

<para>

The VideoLAN Server (vls) can read videos from :

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>an MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 file stored on a hard drive or on a
CD,</para>
<listitem><para>a DVD located in a local DVD drive or copied on a hard
drive,</para>
<listitem><para>a satellite card or a Numeric Television card,</para>
<listitem><para>an MPEG encoding card ;</para>
</itemizedlist>

<para>and stream it over a network to :</para>

<itemizedlist> 

<listitem><para>one machine (i.e. to one IP address) : this is called
<emphasis>unicast</emphasis> ;</para>

<listitem><para>every   machines   on   a   subnet:   this   is   called
<emphasis>broadcast</emphasis> ; </para>

<listitem><para>a dynamic group of machines that the clients can join or leave
(i.e. to a multicast IP address) : this is called
<emphasis>multicast</emphasis>.</para>

</itemizedlist>

<para>

A Pentium 100 MHz with 32 MB of memory should be enough to send one
stream on the network. When streaming a lot of videos stored on a
hard drive, the actual limitation is not the processor but the hard
drive and the network connection.

</para>

<para>

Vls works under Linux, Solaris and Windows. Currently, the Windows
vls version of is only able to stream a video from a file. (not from a DVD)

</para>

<simplesect><title>Mini VideoLAN Channel Server</title>

<para>

Mini VideoLAN Channel Server (mini-vlcs) works on Linux only. It
is designed to give to vlc the informations needed to join channels.
Mini-vlcs is a very small program that can run on a very modest machine.
It can run on the same machine as the VideoLAN Server.

If you have problems using VideoLAN, and if you don't find the
answer to your problem in the documentation, please look at the
