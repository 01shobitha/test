<h1>Apple-VideoLAN partnership announced, Mac VLC to be Intel only</h1>

 <p> FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE </p>

 <p> Paris, France (2006/04/01) - In an effort to help Apple with its
 Intel transition, the VideoLAN team, distributor of the industry leading
 cross-platform media player VLC, announced its intent to drop support for the
 now outdated G4 and G5 based series of Mac computers. </p>

 <p> "We had to do something for Apple in return," former project leader
 Antoine Cellerier said in a public statement earlier today. Cellerier was
 referring to Apple's stance against the French DADVSI law. The controversed
 law, voted in March 2006 by French MPs, seriously jeopardizes VLC's
 development by forbidding French citizens to use software that bypasses
 Digital Right Management, such as DVD encryption or the protection scheme
 commonly found on music bought on the Internet. </p>

 <p> But in late March 2006, Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said the DADVSI
 law would "result in state-sponsored piracy." Apple then threatened to take
 down its French iTunes Music Store. </p>

 <p> Despite Apple's tendency to send cease and desist letters to every
 website on the Internet, the VideoLAN team immediately understood that they
 were in fact trying to help Free Software. "After all, they built OS X on top
 of FreeBSD's cremated remains, and used what could still be saved from KDE's
 bloated web browser to develop Safari, which can only mean they fully embrace
 Open Source," VideoLAN developer Sam Hocevar added. </p>

 <p> The VideoLAN team hence announced that starting from the next release,
 VLC would only run on Mac Intel hardware. Apple is already ahead of schedule;
 the Mac Intels were originally announced for June of 2006, yet that mark
 was beaten by almost half a year. Apple is confident VideoLAN's move will
 help finish the transition. "VLC is the most downloaded OS X application. By
 making it Mac Intel only, we can probably make the transition even faster.
 Let's not repeat the PowerPC fiasco," an Apple spokesperson said. The M68K to
 PowerPC transition, initiated in the 90s, led to the so-called "fat binaries"
 and excruciatingly slow versions of the Mac OS. </p>

 <p> When asked how long older versions of VLC for the G4 and G5 series of
 processors would remain available, a VideoLAN webmaster said, "You'd better
 hurry. Our software is free, but webspace and bandwidth aren't." </p>

 <p> <b>About VideoLAN:</b> VideoLAN (<a
 href="//www.videolan.org/">http://www.videolan.org/</a>) is a project to
 build open source, cross-platform multimedia tools. Their VLC media player
 is the most downloaded Mac OS X application according to versiontracker.com.
 </p>

 <p> <b>About Apple:</b> Apple is the creator of the hyped and overpriced
 Macintosh computer. Until recently, Apple buyers could brag in front of PC
 users about how their PowerPC-based computer was twice as expensive, but also
 twice as powerful as the Intel-based counterpart. Now, thanks to the Intel
 transition, Apple computers are only twice as expensive. </p>
