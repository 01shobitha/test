<h1>Legal concerns</h1>

<h2>May I use the VideoLAN logo?</h2>
<p>You may freely use the VideoLAN logo using the following copyright:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Copyright &copy; 1996-2009 VideoLAN.
This logo or a modified version may be used or modified by anyone to refer to the VideoLAN project
or any product developed by the VideoLAN team, but does not indicate endorsement by the project.
</p></blockquote>

<h2>What are the usage restrictions for VideoLAN software?</h2>
<p>Short answer: there are none.</p>

<p>You can use the software in the way you want (within the boundary of law),
for personal, educational, research, military, governmental and/or professional
purpose.
</p>

<h2>Can I obtain VideoLAN software under different licensing terms?</h2>
<p>You would need to negotiate a new copyright license
with every single copyright holder of the affected piece of software.
You may also need to relicense some underlying libraries.
</p>
<p>In other words, you practically cannot obtain our software
under other licensing terms than normal open-source ones.
</p>

<h2>What about other licenses?</h2>
<p>The binary packages from the VideoLAN website and mirrors
are wholly licensed under their specified license
(normally the GNU General Public License version 2).
You do not need to obtain any separate copyright license.
</p>

<h3>What about patent licenses?</h3>
<p>Regarding <cite>Patentable Inventions</cite>,
the second paragraph
of article 52
of the European Patent Convention (EPC) states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The following (..) shall not be regarded as [patentable] inventions:
scientific theories and mathematical methods; (...)
programs for computers (...).
</p></blockquote>
<p>The VideoLAN project only provides software, i.e. &quot;programs for computers&quot;.
Those are outside the scope of patentability.
Hence there is not need to obtain any patent licenses
for VideoLAN software <strong>within most of Europe</strong>
(European Union, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway,
 San Marino, Switzerland and Turkey).
In other venues, please check any applicable law.
</p>
<p>Please note however that the combination of software with hardware
may yield something patentable.
As such, if you do make a hardware product with VideoLAN software,
you may conceivably need to obtain patent licenses for the hardware parts.
</p>

<h2>May I redistribute a piece of VideoLAN software?</h2>
<p>
Yes, you may distribute an original or a modified version of a piece of VideoLAN software as long as you comply with its license terms. It is the GNU General Public License Version 2 (referred herein as GPL), and it is in the file named COPYING in our products. 
</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to ask the VideoLAN team the permission to do so!
</p>

<h3>How do I do comply with those terms?</h3>
<p>The easiest way to conform to the GPL is to accompany the product you want to distribute with its sources.
</p>

<p>For example, if you plan to distribute the latest binary version of VLC on a DVD-ROM,
you should also include the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html">VLC source code</a>
and the source code for the underlying included libraries on the same media.
</p>

<p>If you plan to distribute the latest binary version of VLC on a website,
you should provide a link to the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html">VLC source code</a>.
</p>

<p>There are other ways to comply with the GPL,
but this should be the simplest one as it does not rely on a contract.
</p>

<h2>Is libdvdcss legal?</h2>
<p> The use and distribution of the libdvdcss library is controversial
in some signatories countries
of the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/">WIPO</a> Copyright Treaty,
and the corresponding European Union Copyright Directive (EUCD) within the EU.
For instance, the United States of America,
it is implemented through the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).
</p>
<p> Different countries implement subtly different restrictions
on the use of anti-piracy counter-measures.
If you are unsure about the legality of using and distributing this library
in your country, please consult your lawyer.
</p>

<p><strong>Beware</strong>:
VLC media player installers for Microsoft Windows and MacOS X
are distributed with the libdvdcss library included.
The VLC media player source code does <strong>not</strong> include libdvdcss.
Also Linux VLC packages normally do not include libdvdcss.
</p>

<h2>Third parties are selling your software.
<a name="sale">Is this legal?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, absolutely.
</p>
<p>Our licensing terms explicitly allow selling or sublicensing our software.
We allow that very much on purpose.
For instance, we like computer magazines to include our software on their CDs,
and we also like Linux distributions, PC manufacturers and storage device
vendors to pre-install our software and make money out of it.
For us, that is basically zero-cost advertisement.
See also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html">the rationale
from the Free Software Foundation</a> (those who wrote our licensing terms).
</p>
<p>We reckon that certain form of sales, such as online commercial downloads,
provide no value to us neither our customers.
Many people consider those sales to be deceptive, if not outright fraudulent.
As our software can be downloaded for free from our website and mirrors,
<cite>there should be no need to pay</cite>.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to differentiate good and bad sales,
so we allow all of them.
Besides, we are open-source enthusiasts, not lawyers.
</p>

<h2>I bought your software.
<a name="refund">How do I get a refund?</a></h2>
<p>The VideoLAN project and its <kbd>videolan.org</kbd> website
are in no way involved with retail or gross sale of any product.
As a consequence, the VideoLAN project is unable to provide any refund.
To put it bluntly, we did not get your money, so we cannot give it back.
</p>
<p>If you want a refund for software from the VideoLAN project,
you must solicit it from the merchant that sold you the product.
Depending on the applicable consumer protection laws and contractual terms
you could have agreed to,
you might consider turning to the financial intermediaries,
and/or the competent administration for commercial fraud
(e.g. the DGCCRF in France).
