<h1>VideoLAN</h1>

<div id="left">

<h2>The VideoLAN Project</h2>
  <p>The VideoLAN project is a project, lead and composed by a team of volunteers,
  that believe in the power of open source when dealing with multimedia.</p>
  <p>VideoLAN produces
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
  software</a> for multimedia, released under the GNU <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a>. </p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>The project started as a student project at the French <a
  href="http://www.ecp.fr/">École Centrale Paris</a>, in 1996.
  After a complete rewrite in 1998, it became Open Source, thanks to the agreement
  of the École Centrale Paris, in 2001.</p>
  <p>The project started to open up to developers outside of the École.
  It is now a worldwide project with <a href="/videolan/team/">developers</a> from 20 countries.</p>
  <p>Since 2009, the project is completly separated from École Centrale Paris,
  and is backed up by an autonomous non-profit organisation.</p>

<h2>The VideoLAN non-profit organisation</h2>
<p>The VideoLAN project is backed up by the VideoLAN organisation, based in France.</p>
<p>The VideoLAN non-profit organisation has a board and members that are part of the VideoLAN project.</p>
<p>The current board of VideoLAN is composed by:
<ul class="bullets">
<li>President: Jean-Baptiste Kempf,</li>
<li>Treasurer: Rémi Duraffort,</li>
<li>Secretary: Antoine Cellerier.</li>
</ul>
