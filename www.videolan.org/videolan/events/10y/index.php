<h1>Day 1: a VideoLAN history</h1>
<p>Most people know <a href="/vlc"/>VLC</a>, but they don't know the history of the <a href="/videolan/">VideoLAN project</a>.</p>
<p>Well, they don't even know what VideoLAN is, and that we are not a company...</p>
<h2>1st February 2011</h2>
<p>Today is the <b>10<sup>th</sup> anniversary</b> of the switch to <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">GPL</a> of the VideoLAN project
applications...</p>
<p>But, but, but... What was <em>before</em> the GPL?</p>

<h3>1996: First VideoLAN project</h3>
<p>The network of the campus of the <a href="http://www.ecp.fr">École Centrale Paris</a>,
one of the prestigious French "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_ecole">Grande École</a>"
university, has always been managed by a student organisation named <a href="http://www.via.ecp.fr">
VIA Centrale Réseaux</a>.</p>
<p>In 1996, it had a very slow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_ring">Token-Ring</a> network, but the students wanted an upgrade. They found investors
at the condition that they could justify the need for a new network...</p>
<p>Therefore, they decided to push <b>Video</b> on the network...<br />
<p>Remember, this is <b>1996</b>, were your average Pentium couldn't decode a DVD and when Youtube and Google didn't exist...</p>
<p>This <b>student project</b> was a success in early 1998, and a new network came.</p>

<h3>1998: Second VideoLAN project</h3>
<p>As it was successful, it was decided to go on the project.</p>
<p>And they restarted the project from scratch, in <b>1998</b>.<br />
<p>But in the mind of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> and modularity.</p>
<p>This is when the <a href="/vlc/">VLC media player</a> that you know of, was <i>born</i>.<br />
If you look at the <em>first commit</em> of the repository, in <b>August 1999</b>, you'll see that the most copyright
indeed is from <b>1998</b>.</p>

<h3>2001: Open Source</h3>
<p>As <a href="/">VideoLAN</a> was a student project, the university had moral rights on the software produced.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <b>students</b> and Professor <a href="http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/jean-philippe-rey/16/b19/95a">Jean-Philippe Rey</a>,
 the direction of the university allowed the switch of all code produced to GPL.</p>
<p>The letter from Mr. Gourisse was signed on February 1<sup>st</sup>, <b>2001</b>.</p>

<h2>Since 2001</h2>
<p>Afterward, the project has went on, with <b>students</b> and then <b>volunteers</b> from around the world.</p>
<p>The project, has, of course, left the university and is a backed-up by a <b>volunteer non-profit organisation</b>.</p>

<h2>Support us</h2>
<p>Since all the work on <a href="/vlc/">VLC</a> and other <a href="/projects">videolan projects</a> is done by <b>volunteers</b>
in their <b>free time</b>, we welcome donations to help us manage the software.</p>
<p><b>Donate <a href="/contribute.html">now!</a></b></p>
