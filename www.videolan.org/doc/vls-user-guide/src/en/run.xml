Running VLS

</title>
<sect1><title>Launching VLS</title>
<para>
If you want to use the telnet interface, running
VLS is very easy: just type <command>vls</command> in a shell
console, and that's all. Running <command>vlsd</command> will
start VLS as a daemon and will detach itself from the launching
shell. Remember that VLS will try to load its configuration file
(<filename>vls.cfg</filename>) from the current directory, and if
there is no <filename>vls.cfg</filename> there, it will try to load it
from <filename>SYSCONF_DIR/etc/videolan</filename> (see section <xref linkend="config" endterm="tconfig"/>).
</para>
<caution><para>
If your log file is <filename>vls.log</filename> as
in the example, VLS will need write access in the current directory, or
you will see something like:

</para>
<screen><computeroutput>
*** Exception *** in copy constructor (0xbffffc98, copy of 0x80e30a8)
Unable to open the log file "vls.log": Error: Could not open file 'vls.log':
Permission denied
</computeroutput></screen>
<para>
Remember also that you must be root when using the
"Interface" option in <filename>vls.cfg</filename>.
</para>
</caution>
<para>
If everything is right, you will see something like:

</para>
<screen><computeroutput>
VideoLAN Server v 0.5.3 (Jun  6 2003) - (c)1999-2003 VideoLAN
2002-03-09 17:24:51 [INFO/Vls]  Module "channel:file" registered

</computeroutput></screen>
<para>
What you can see on the screen (stderr) is exactly
what goes in the log file <filename>vls.log</filename>.
</para>
<para>
When VLS has been successfully started, it doesn't
take any command from its standard input, so you can put it into
background (you can use the <emphasis>screen</emphasis> utility to do
that).
</para>
<para>
On the other hand, if you want to
use the command line interface, please see the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/">VideoLAN HOWTO</ulink>.

Using the telnet interface

</title>
<para>
After VLS has been launched, it opens a telnet
server (on the port 9999 by default). You can connect to this server
with the following command:

</para>
<screen>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>telnet localhost 9999</userinput>
</screen>
<para>
You should see something like:

</para>
<screen><computeroutput>
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to vls.
Escape character is '^]'.
Videolan Server Administration System
Login:
</computeroutput></screen>
<para>
Then you must authenticate with a login/password
pair defined in <filename>vls.cfg</filename>. When you have been
successfully authenticated, you should see a prompt like:

</para>

<screen><computeroutput>
admin@vls&gt;
</computeroutput>&gt;</screen>
<para>
Then you can type some commands, which are explained
in the next paragraph. To log out, type <command>logout</command> after
the telnet prompt.
