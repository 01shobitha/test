<h1>VideoLAN mailing-lists</h1>

<p>The VideoLAN mailing-lists are used for the developement
and the user support of the VideoLAN project. They are only
<b>English-speaking</b>.</p>

<p>Please try to stay on-topic. The developers are subscribed to
the user lists as well, so do not post to a development list because
you can't compile a program.</p>

<p>All the mailing-lists are in "closed-post" mode, which mean
that messages from people who are not subscribed to the list
need to go through a moderation process, which can take many
hours, but is a necessary evil to avoid spam. The exception is
the <code><b>videolan-announce</b></code> list, which is fully
moderated.</p>

<p>You can consult the
<a href="http://mailman.videolan.org/">online archives</a>.</p>
<p>You can also consult the <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.video.videolan">Gmane</a> archives of the mailing-lists.</p>

<h2>Subscription / Unsubscription</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://mailman.videolan.org">subscribe or unsubscribe</a>
from the web.</p>
