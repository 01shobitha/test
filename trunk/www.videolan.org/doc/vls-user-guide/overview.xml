<sect1><title>VLS structure</title>

<para>From a user's point of view, VLS can be divided into four
kinds of components:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>a <emphasis>manager</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>inputs</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>converters</emphasis>,</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>and <emphasis>channels</emphasis>.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<simplesect><title>Input</title>

<para>The role of an <emphasis>input</emphasis> is to read MPEG
streams from a given source (file, DVD, DVB card, device, ...), and
feed the right <emphasis>converters</emphasis> with these streams.
An input may be able to read several streams, which are called
<emphasis>programs</emphasis>. There are several kinds of
inputs:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>the <emphasis>local</emphasis> input, which can read videos
from files or DVDs,</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>the <emphasis>video</emphasis> input, which
can read videos from MPEG encoding cards devices,</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>the <emphasis>dvb</emphasis> input, which
can read videos from DVB cards,</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>the <emphasis>v4l</emphasis> input, which
can read from acquisition cards supported by the Video4Linux
drivers.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>You can use several inputs and play several
programs at the same time.</para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect><title>Converter</title>

<para>The role of a <emphasis>converter</emphasis> is to receive a
stream from an input, and convert it into the MPEG-TS format. If you
don't know what PS or TS are, here is some explanation. When you play
an MPEG video from a DVD, for instance, the MPEG stream is actually
composed of several streams (called Elementary Streams): there is
one stream for video, one for audio, another for subtitles, and so
on. These different streams are mixed together into a single Program
Stream (PS). So, the .VOB files you can find in a DVD are actually
MPEG2-PS files. But this PS format is not adapted for streaming
video through a network or by satellite, for instance. So, another
format called Transport Stream (TS) was designed for streaming MPEG
videos through such channels. VLS is able to convert PS
streams (from DVDs, for instance) into TS streams (ps2ts converter). Of
course, it can also read TS streams, and fix them by handling stream
discontinuities (ts2ts converter).</para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect><title>Channel</title>

<para>A <emphasis>channel</emphasis> receives a stream from a
converter, and send it to a given destination (network, file, ...).
If you want, you can call a "channel" an "output": it is the
same thing !). Currently, two kinds of channels are supported:
<emphasis>network</emphasis> and <emphasis>file</emphasis>. Note that,
at the moment, VLS can support only one output per
stream, so you cannot play a stream on the network and write it into
a file at the same time. The network output is highly configurable:
you can choose which network interface you want to use, and specify
source and destination IP addresses.</para>

</simplesect>

<simplesect><title>Manager</title>

<para>The <emphasis>manager</emphasis> controls the way streams are
sent. Through an <emphasis>administration interface</emphasis>,
you can tell the manager to start, stop, suspend, resume, forward or
rewind the different programs. You can also get a list of all programs
available in the Program Table. The manager gets this table from the
VLS configuration file (<filename>vls.cfg</filename>), so it cannot
be changed once VLS has been started. At the moment, you cannot ask
the manager whether a given stream is being broadcasted, but you
will get an error message if you try to stop a stream that was not
broadcasted.</para>

<sect1><title>Administration interface</title>

<para>There are currently two ways to launch the streaming:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>you can use the <emphasis>command line</emphasis> to
give arguments at startup;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>oy you can use the <emphasis>telnet interface</emphasis> to
start/stop/pause the streaming whenever you want.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>When using the telnet interface, you must authenticate before
typing any command, because any user may not be allowed to execute any
command (this can be configured in the <filename>vls.cfg</filename>
configuration file).</para>
