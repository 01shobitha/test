<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="videolan-quickstart.html#toc1.1">What is the VideoLAN project ?</A>
</H2>


<P>VideoLAN is a complete software solution for video streaming, developed
by students at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ecp.fr">Ecole Centrale Paris</A> and contributors from all over the world, under the 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License (GPL)</A>. It has been designed for streaming MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 videos on
local area networks (LAN), but it can be extended to metropolitan or
wide area networks (MAN, WAN), thanks to the multicast technology.</P>
<P>The VideoLAN solution includes a server, which can stream video from
various sources (file, DVD, satellite and MPEG 2 encoder), a client, which can
receive, decode and display MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 streams and, if necessary,
a channel server which tells automatically to the client the parameters
needed to receive the stream.</P>
<P>Here is an illustration of the complete VideoLAN solution :</P>

</H2>



<H3>Skills</H3>

<P> </P>
<P>Basic skills on Linux and Network should be enough.</P>

<H3>VideoLAN Client</H3>


<P>The VideoLAN Client (vlc) works on many platforms : Linux, Windows, Mac
OS X, BeOS, *BSD, Solaris, iPaq, QNX. It can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and
MPEG 4 / DivX files from a hard disk or a CD-ROM drive, read DVDs and
VCDs and read from a satellite card. But the most important function
is that it can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVDs streamed on a network. Vlc
requires at least a Pentium 400Mhz with 32MB of RAM.</P>

<H3>VideoLAN Server and mini-Server</H3>


<P>The VideoLAN Server (vls) can read videos from :
<UL>
<LI>an MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 file stored on a hard drive or on a CD,</LI>
<LI>a DVD located in a local DVD drive or copied on a hard drive,</LI>
<LI>a satellite card,</LI>
<LI>an MPEG encoding card ;</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>and stream it on a network to :
<UL>
<LI>one machine (i.e. to one IP address) : this is called <B>unicast</B> ;
</LI>
<LI>all the machines of a subnet (i.e. to a broadcast IP address) :
this is called <B>broadcast</B> ;
</LI>
<LI>a dynamic group of machines that the clients can join or leave
(i.e. to a multicast IP address) : this is called <B>multicast</B>.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>A Pentium 100 MHz with 32 MB of memory should be enough to send one
stream on the network. When streaming a lot of videos stored on a
hard drive, the actual limitation is not the processor but the hard
drive and the network connection.</P>
<P>Vls works under Linux, Solaris and Windows. Currently, the Windows
vls version of is only able to stream a video from a file.</P>
<P>The VideoLAN mini-Server (vlms) is only capable of streaming an MPEG
file. Vlms works on Linux only. It is easier to install and configure
than vls and should be used mainly for testing purposes.</P>

<H3>Get a streamable MPEG file</H3>


<P>Vls and vlms can stream MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 files that meet two
critera :</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>the file must be MPEG <B>PS</B> (Program Stream) or MPEG
<B>TS</B> (Transport Stream), that contain video and audio
multiplexed. Vls and vlms cannot stream MPEG ES (Elementary Stream),
i.e. a file with only audio or video.

In order to know if an MPEG file is MPEG <B>PS</B>, MPEG <B>TS</B>
or MPEG <B>ES</B>, read the file with vlc and look at the messages
(with the interface : Click on "View" and "Messages", or use the command
line "vlc -v") and look for a line :

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
module: locking demux module `mpeg_XX'
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


If XX = ps or XX = ts, then your file is MPEG <B>PS</B> and MPEG
<B>TS</B> respectively , and you may be able to stream it. If XX = es,
then your file is MPEG <B>ES</B> and is not streamable.

</LI>
<LI>the sequence header of the video must repeat itself regularly,
which is often the case with MPEG 2, but very rare with MPEG 1. There is
no easy way to know if the sequence header is repeated regularly.

Files with a <CODE>.vob</CODE> extension are normally MPEG
2 files and files with <CODE>.mpg</CODE> or <CODE>.mpeg</CODE> extension or usually
MPEG 1 files.
</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>You can download this streamable MPEG 2 PS file for your tests : 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/videolan/streams/presentation/presentation_short.vob">ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/videolan/streams/presentation/presentation_short.vob</A>.</P>

<H3>Mini VideoLAN Channel Server</H3>


<P>Mini VideoLAN Channel Server (mini-vlcs) works on Linux only. It
is designed to give to vlc the informations needed to join channels.
Mini-vlcs is a very small program that can run on a very modest machine.
It can run on the same machine as vls or vlms.</P>

<H3>The Network</H3>


<P>You will need a network, which can be as small as one ethernet 10 / 100 Mbit/s
switch or hub, and as big as the whole Internet ! See if your network
supports "multicast". The bandwidth needed is :
<UL>
<LI>6 to 9 Mbit/s for a DVD,</LI>
<LI>3 to 4 Mbit/s for an MPEG 1 stream, an MPEG 2 stream (from a satellite
or an MPEG 2 encoding card).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5</A> <A HREF="videolan-quickstart.html#toc1.5">About this Quickstart</A>
</H2>


<P>This Quickstart is organised in five steps. You must follow them in the
order of the Quickstart. After those five steps, you will have a small
view of what VideoLAN can do, but it can do even more ! To know about
the other functions, please refer to the 
<A HREF="#doc">other documentation</A>.</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>vlc@videolan.org</CODE> for the questions on vlc,</LI>
<LI><CODE>vls@videolan.org</CODE> for the questions on vls and vlms,</LI>
