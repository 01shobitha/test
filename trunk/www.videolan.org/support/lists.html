<h1>VideoLAN user mailing-lists</h1>

<p>The VideoLAN user mailing-lists are dedicated to :
<ul>
<li>user support for VideoLAN software,</li>
<li>announces for VideoLAN releases and events.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are <b>English-speaking</b> mailing-lists.</p>

<p>All the mailing-lists are in "closed-post" mode, which mean
that messages from people who are not subscribed to the list
need to go through a moderation process, which can take many
hours, but is a necessary evil to avoid spam. The exception is
the <code><b>videolan-announce</b></code> list, which is fully
moderated.</p>

<p>You can consult the
<a href="http://www.via.ecp.fr/ml/videolan/">online archives</a> hosted at
VIA.</p>
