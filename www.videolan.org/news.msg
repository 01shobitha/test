|26 October 2008|End of support for VLC 0.8.6 series|The VideoLAN team ceases all form of support for VLC media player the 0.8.6-bugfix tree.

After several several call for help,
it is apparent that there is no interest in the community
to maintain the 0.8.6 branch of the VLC media player.
As a consequence, it has not been possible to put sufficient efforts
to ensure adequate continued quality of the 0.8.6-bugfix branch.
Effective immediately,
there will be no more security and critical fixes for VLC 0.8.6.
Binary releases of the 0.8.6-bugfix branch had already stopped as of July 2008.

The VideoLAN team will continue to provide major or security-related bug fixes
for the VLC media player 0.9-bugfix branch.
If you have not already upgraded to VLC version 0.9.5, please do so urgently
(exploits for vulnerabilities found in older versions are widely available
 as of today).

|24 October 2008|VLC media player 0.9.5|The VideoLAN team is pleased to announce the release of VLC media player 0.9.5.

This is a bugfix release. VLC media player 0.9.4 and earlier versions suffer from a security vulnerability in TiVo demuxer. Further technical details are available in <a href="http://www.videolan.org/security/sa0809.html">our advisory</a> (CVE-2008-4654, CVE-2008-4686). Also, libpng was updated in Windows and MacOS builds to address a separate security issue (CVE-2008-3964).<br />

This release also improves media keys support under Windows, file access under all OSes, Qt4 interface usability, and fixes a few extra bugs. Full list of changes can be found <a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/NEWS">here</a>.<br />

We utmostly recommend all users upgrade to this new version.<br />

Binary packages for <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html">source code tarballs</a> are available for download. Windows binary release is indefinitely postponed pending volunteers taking over the Windows port.<br />

Help is available, as usual, in many places:
</p>
<ul class="bullets"><li>The <a href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Documentation/">documentation</a> (we need help keeping it up to date!)</li><li>The <a href=" http://forum.videolan.org">forums</a></li><li>The <a href="http://www.videolan.org/support/lists.html">mailing lists</a></li><li>IRC: #videolan on Freenode</li></ul>

<p>We'd like to thank all our contributors, testers and users around the world for their support and help making this release possible.

|9 October 2008|A problem with Mac OS X PPC 0.9.4 binary|We accidently released the 0.9.3 Mac OS X PowerPC binary as the 0.9.4 download. We apologize for this, and corrected PowerPC and Universal downloads have been uploaded to our main mirror. It will take up to a day for these binaries to be distributed to some of our mirrors. If you want you can download the file <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.9.4/macosx/vlc-0.9.4-powerpc.dmg">directly from our main server</a>.

|7 October 2008|VLC media player 0.9.4 and Call for Windows developers|We present you with VLC media player 0.9.4, the latest increment of our 0.9 series. This release brings Windows users all the 0.9.3 enhancements and fixes (please see our call for Windows developers below) as well as fixing a few more bugs for the other platforms.
</p>
<p>Binary packages for <a href="vlc/download-macosx.html">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="vlc/download-windows.html">Windows</a>, as well as source code tarballs are available for download.<br /> Help is available, as usual, in many places:

<p>We'd like to thank all our contributors, testers and users around the world for their support and help making this release possible.<br /><br />We are putting out a call for NEW Windows developers. At the moment, our Windows-port is sorely missing some much needed love from a true Windows developer. Our team has been without a Windows developer for several months now, which is blocking us from supporting our largest usergroup in the manner we want to. We are therefore looking for developers to help our team in the areas of debugging crashes, Direct X, A/V capturing, ActiveX and Windows integration, so we can hopefully resume supporting our largest group of users in the best possible way. If we are unable to find new developers, new versions of VLC media player for Windows might become less frequent and severely out of sync with the Linux and Mac OS X versions.<br /><br />
So, no donations for work on the Windows-port and no "opportunities"-emails, for Windows we only require: Developers, Developers, Developers !!!!!

|17 September 2008|VLC media player at IBC 2008|<a href="http://www.ibc.org">IBC 2008</a> is the 2nd largest conference and exhibition on Broadcasting technology in the world. Though VLC media player does not have a stand (terribly expensive), it is used on many stands by the attending companies. As every year, several of the VLC media player developers were present on the floor and Derk-Jan Hartman made a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/d.j.hartman/IBC2008#">photo report</a> showing some of the uses, by companies like: HP, Cisco, Anystream, Fraunhofer, BBC and many smaller companies.|
It is the industries 'dirty little secret' you could say. Much of the IPTV based work starts by testing the IPTV streams with VLC media player. New features are sometimes even implemented in VLC media player for internal development, and then once it works, the engineers write a new program based on their experiences, which they deliver to their customers. However sometimes VLC media player even makes it into the endproduct. Big name HP clearly <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/d.j.hartman/IBC2008#5246709674847748114">uses VLC media player in this product of theirs</a>.

|29 August 2006| New MacIntel server| The builds for Mac OS X Intel were still being produced on a Development Kit Intel machine from Apple. It's time to bring that machine back to Apple and as a replacement the VideoLAN team has used the donations of our users in order to purchase a new server. The original idea was to get a MacMini, but in the configuration we wanted it, we could just as well get an iMac. Which is what we did. We <a href="http://sidekick.student.utwente.nl/gallery/album01/DSC00244?full=1">received</a> the machine last week, and now it's <a href="http://sidekick.student.utwente.nl/gallery/album01/DSC00245?full=1">setup</a>, and <a href="http://buildbot.videolan.org">keeping an eye</a> on VLC for MacIntel.

valid XHTML glory.

|2 feb 2001| First official release! | Director of École Centrale Paris
has <a href="/images/paper.jpeg">signed</a> the authorization to release
all the VideoLAN components under the GPL.

|31 jan 2001| See the new vlc at the Linux Expo in Paris | vlc has been
forked into two branches: stable (0.2.0, codenamed Onatopp) and unstable
(0.2.50, codenamed Urumov). Unstable has a lot of new interesting
features.

|20 jan 2001| Changed web server | We have moved the web site to our
brand new IBM server. Please let us know if anything goes wrong on the
web pages.

|07 dec 2000| VideoLAN on a floppy | For our beta-tests campaign on our
local network, we have created a boot floppy allowing non-Linux users to
boot off the floppy and load the vlc through an NFS mountage. It rocks!

|06 dec 2000| New beta-test campaign! | VideoLAN is not vlc. It's a
whole network solution; we are testing again, on our LAN, as many
improvements have been done to the three part of the project ( videolan
server, vlan solution, client ) since we last tested it. We expect about
50 to 100 beta-testers. See the test section if you are a student in the
Residence of the Ecole Centrale.

|22 nov 2000| For rh7.0 users ... | Redhat 7.0 users may have
difficulties to build the vlc, as the version included in rh7.0 isn't a
stable one. We advice you either to take the rpm or to downgrade to gcc
2.95

|27 aug 2000| Release: vlc 0.1.99i | A new version of the VideoLAN

issue has been fixed, we got a 40% speed increase!

|11 aug 2000| New TODO list | We did a <a href="/vlc/todo.html">TODO

authorizations in order to distribute the VideoLAN components under the
General Public License. Our school director still needs to sign one
paper.

|24 jan 2000| More performance increase | Our new custom video decoder
gives us a 50% speed increase. We now can play DVDs at full framerate on
a Celeron 366 using framebuffer output, which makes the vlc the fastest
