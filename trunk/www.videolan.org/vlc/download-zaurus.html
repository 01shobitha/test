<h1>VLC for Zaurus</h1>

<p>VLC for Zaurus is still in an experimental state. It has been reporting working on several Zaurus setups but may not working on others. No member of the project owns a Zaurus so we depend on your feedback. Please tell us if VLC works on your Zaurus and also if it doesn't. We need your feedback to keep this page up to date.</p>

<h2>Package download </h2>

<p>The latest release for Zaurus is version v0.5.3. It can be downloaded with the link below. Do not forget to also install the additional libraries that are listed on this page. VLC for zaurus will not function without them.</p>

<ul>
<?
    pkgitem("vlc/ipkg-feed/armv4l/v0.5.3/zaurus", "zaurus-vlc_0.5.3_arm.ipk");
?>
</ul>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>VLC for zaurus comes currently without a user interface and is thus only accessible through the commandline. There is a script called zaurus-vlc that will aid you to launch vlc in the Opie environment.</p>

<h2>Additional libraries needed</h2>

<p>Zaurus vlc needs the following packages installed:</p>

<ul>
<?
     pkgitem("vlc/ipkg-feed/armv4l/v0.5.3/zaurus", "zaurus-libsdl_1.2.5_arm.ipk");
     pkgitem("vlc/ipkg-feed/armv4l/v0.5.3", "libffmpeg_0.4.6_20030304_arm.ipk");
?>
</ul>

<h2>Libc extras needed</h2>

<p>The Zaurus comes with a tailored down libc installation. VLC depends on one extra library that is not provided by default. Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<?
     pkgitem("vlc/ipkg-feed/armv4l/v0.5.2/linupy", "librt-2.1.3.tar.gz");
?>
</ul>

<h3>Installation instructions:</h3>

<p>First you must become root user then perform the following steps.</p>

<pre>
# cd /
# tar xzvf librt-2.1.3.tar.gz
# ldconfig
</pre>
