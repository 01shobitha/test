<h1>Introduction to VideoLAN</h1>

<h2>The team</h2>

<p>VideoLAN is a project of <a href="team/index.html">French students</a>
of the <a href="http://www.ecp.fr/">École Centrale Paris</a> and
developers from all over the world.</p>

<h2>The goal</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN project aims at setting up a complete solution for
streaming video on a network. Today, it is specialised in high quality
video (MPEG 1 and 2) streamed over a Local Area Network (LAN). But it can
already be used on a Wide Area Network (WAN) thanks to the multicast
technology.</p>

<h2>The philosophy</h2>

<p>VideoLAN is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>,
and is released under the GNU
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a>.
It has adopted the OpenSource model of developement with developers
around the world contributing to the code via CVS and discussing of
the developement issues in English-speaking mailing-lists and on an
English-speaking IRC channel.</p>

<h1>The technical solution</h1>

<h2>The global architecture</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN solution is splited into three parts:</p>
<ul>

<li>The VideoLAN Server (vls) which can read video from a hard drive, a
DVD player, a Satellite Card or and MPEG 2 encoding card and stream it
on the network,</li>

<li>The VideoLAN Client (vlc) which can read the stream from the
network, decode and display the video under Windows, Linux, and
BeOS.</li>

</ul>

<p>This diagram illustrates the VideoLAN solution:</p>

<h2>The VideoLAN Server</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN Server (vls) works on Linux only. Vls can read video from:</p>
<ul>
<li>an MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 file stored on a hard drive or on a CD,</li>
<li>a DVD located in a local DVD drive or copied on a hard drive,</li>
<li>a satellite card,</li>
<li>an MPEG encoding card ;</li>
</ul>

<p>and stream it on a network to:</p>
<ul>
<li>one machine (i.e. to one IP address): this is called unicast ;</li>
<li>all the machines of a subnet (i.e. to a broadcast IP address): this is called broadcast ;</li>
<li>a dynamic list of machines to which the clients can subscribe or unsubscribe (i.e. to a multicast IP address): this is called multicast.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The VideoLAN Client</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN Client (vlc) works on many platforms: Linux, Windows,
Mac OS X, BeOS, *BSD, Solaris, iPaq, QNX. It can read MPEG 1 and MPEG 2
files from a hard disk or a CD-ROM drive, read DVDs and VCDs and read
from a satellite card. But the most important function is that it can
read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVDs streamed on a network. Vlc requires at
least a Pentium 400Mhz with 32MB of RAM.</p>

<h2>The Network</h2>

<p>The network on which you setup the VideoLAN solution can be as small as
one ethernet 10/100Mb switch or hub, and as big as the whole Internet !
The bandwidth needed is:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 to 9 Mbit/s for a DVD,</li>
<li>3 to 4 Mbit/s for an MPEG 1 stream, an MPEG 2 stream (from a satellite or an MPEG 2 encoding card).</li>
</ul>
