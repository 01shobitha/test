1. MSYS/MinGW environment
=========================

Setting up a working MSYS/MinGW environment requires the following:

1. MSYS installation
2. Updating MSYS
3. MSYS DTK (Developer Tool Kit)
4. Updating bash (shell)
5. MinGW installation
6. Configuration of fstab
7. Creation of home folder

Note that the following generic resource locations were used to download the
appropriate packages (and more recent versions might be obtained from here).

- MSYS/MinGW related:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw

- nasm, SDL, zip, pkg-config and sed packages:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nasm
http://www.libsdl.org
http://www.info-zip.org
http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/sed


1.1 Minimal SYStem (MSYS) installation
======================================

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe

Perform a basic installation into C:\msys

Do not continue with the post install (this will be done later).


1.2 Update MSYS
===============

Update MSYS to a more recent version

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-20060807.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file, it contains the following files:

mount.exe, msys-1.0.dll and ps.exe

Copy the files to:

C:\msys\bin

This will overwrite/update the version(s) used in MSYS.


1.3 MSYS DTK (Developer Tool Kit)
=================================

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/msysDTK-1.0.1.exe

Perform a basic installation into C:\msys


1.4 Updating BASH
=================

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/bash-3.1-MSYS-1.0.11-snapshot.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file, in the bin subfolder it contains the following files:

bash.exe and sh.exe

Copy the files to:

C:\msys\bin

This will overwrite/update the sh.exe version used in MSYS


1.5 MinGW
=========

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.0.3.exe

Select the download and install option.

Do not install with "Current" MinGW packages but select "Candidate".

Select the following components to install:

- MinGW base tools (autoselected)
- g++ compiler

Perform the installation into the default destination:

C:\msys\mingw

The following versions (or possibly newer) of the candidate packages will be
downloaded and installed:

mingw-runtime-3.10.tar.gz
w32api-3.7.tar.gz
binutils-2.16.91-20060119-1.tar.gz
gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz
gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz

(It is also possible to get these packages seperately and extract them to C:\msys\mingw)


1.6 Configuring fstab
=====================

The folder C:\msys\etc contains the following file:

fstab.sample

Copy the file to:

fstab

Open the file with a text editor and change the path value for the mingw mount
point from:

c:/mingw to c:/msys/mingw

Save the file.


1.7 Starting MSYS
=================

4. Troubleshooting
==================

Various issues..


4.1 Make .qt4 from extras/contrib
=================================

Fails on:

checking for libmpeg2.a in /home/Administrator/vlc-trunk/./extras/contrib/src/mpeg2dec... no
configure: error: cannot cd to /home/Administrator/vlc-trunk/./extras/contrib/src/mpeg2dec

Workaround: configure with --without-contrib


4.2 Make package-win32-zip
==========================

Fails on:

sed -i 's%share/osdmenu%osdmenu%g' ./vlc-0.9.0-svn/osdmenu/*.cfg
sed: invalid option -- i

Workaround: compile sed 4.09 (any newer versions fail to compile on missing alloca)

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/sed/sed-4.0.9.tar.gz

use the newer sed version in c:\msys\mingw\bin and rename the old one to sed3.exe or something

ONLY use the 4.09 sed to do a make package-win32-zip, it will fail to compile VLC source
(so after it finishes, you have to copy the old version back again).

So in conclusion:

make package-win32-zip fails with sed 3.02 on -i
make autoconf fails with sed 4.09 on -E
sed 4.10+ requires glib
glib requires pkgconfig but pkgconfig requires glib?!


4.3 Warnings during configure
