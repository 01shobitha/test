<h2>New VLC releases</h2>
<p>
VideoLAN and the VLC development teams are proud to publish a major new release of VLC.<br
/><br
/>The&nbsp; 2.2.0 release of VLC media player for the desktop is coordinated, for&nbsp; the first time ever, with releases on iOS, Android (including Android&nbsp; TV), WinRT (Windows RT and x86) and Windows Phone. <i>VLC runs everywhere!</i><br
/><br
/>Those&nbsp; releases are the result of more than one year of volunteer work, add&nbsp; numerous new features, fix more than one thousand bugs and improves&nbsp; the scope of the formats supported.<br
/>The releases on all the platforms share the same core to support video and audio formats, named libVLC:<i> VLC plays everything!</i><br
/>
<h2>News</h2>
<p>So, what's new in <b>VLC 2.2.0</b>, codename <i>WeatherWax</i>?</p>
<ul><li>Fight&nbsp; the popular vertical video syndrome! VLC automatically detects rotated&nbsp; videos and rotates them using hardware acceleration (on compatible&nbsp; platforms)!</li
><li>This is supported for MP4/MOV, MKV and raw H264.</li
><li>Resume playback&nbsp; where you left off. Supported on all the mobile versions of VLC for&nbsp; quite some time, it is now available on the desktop.</li
><li>Vastly improved support for UltraHD video codecs like VP9 and H265, including encoding.</li
><li>New&nbsp; hardware acceleration mechanism, GPU 0-copy decoding, faster and&nbsp; implementations for Linux, Android, and Raspberry Pi. (Other OSes will&nbsp; have it in 3.0.0)</li
><li>Extensions: supported since a long time, we now feature an in-app downloader for the desktop, like Firefox</li
><li>Subtitles downloading extension</li
><li>Compatibility with a very large number of unusual codecs</li
><li>Vastly improved compatibility for problematic files in Ogg, MP4, and WMV.</li
><li>Support for Digital Cinema Package to play native movie theater formats.</li
><li>Experimental support of Interactive Menus of BluRays: BD-J</li
><li>On OS X, we've updated the interface for Yosemite compatibility.</li
><li>On Android, we rewrote most of the UI to match Google Material Design.</li
><li>This is the first public beta releases for Windows Phone, Windows RT and Android TV.</li
><li>It is also the first non-beta release on Android.</li></ul>

<p>This&nbsp; is made possible through a lot of improvements of the VLC engine, the&nbsp; libVLC library, which starts showing its maturity and solidity.</p>

<p>Therefore, today, we release:</p>
<ul><li>VLC media player 2.2.0</li
><li>VLC for iOS 2.4.1</li
><li>VLC for Android 1.1.0</li
><li>VLC for Android TV 1.1.0</li
><li>VLC for WinRT 1.1.0</li
><li>VLC for Windows RT 1.1.0 Beta</li
><li>VLC for Windows Phone 1.1.0 Beta</li></ul>
<p>We hope that you like our new release as much as we do and we are looking forward to answer any question you might have.</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>
<h3>Jean-Baptiste Kempf, president of the VideoLAN non-profit:</h3>
"I'm&nbsp; very happy about those releases. Moving VLC to the mobile world was&nbsp; difficult, but the difficult is done. VLC runs everywhere, plays&nbsp; everything. We're working on many new features for VLC 3.0.0 to finish&nbsp; what we've started here."<br
/>"We're quite happy to see that libVLC&nbsp; and the libVLC SDK on all platforms are now demonstrating that this&nbsp; framework is now ready for production."<br
/><br
/><h3>Felix Paul KÃ¼hne, secretary of the VideoLAN non-profit and iOS Lead Developer:</h3>
"Synchronizing&nbsp; the release leads to an unprecedented level of run-time stability and&nbsp; future innovation. We are excited about sharing further results from&nbsp; that work later this year."<br
/><br
/><h3>Ludovic Fauvet, treasurer of the VideoLAN non-profit:</h3>
"The VideoLAN community shows this time again an unprecedented level of professionalism in releasing VLC media player 2.2.0 simultaneously on all supported platforms. This is a groundbreaking change that any contributor can be proud of."<br
/><br
/>
<h2>Notes on 3.0.0</h2>
So&nbsp; far, the development on VLC 3.0.0, which will be released later this&nbsp; year, brings hardware decoding and acceleration to more platforms, a&nbsp; better support for mp4, adaptive streaming and TS streams and a partial&nbsp; ChromeCast integration.<br
/><br
