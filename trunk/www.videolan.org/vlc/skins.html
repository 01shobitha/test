<h1> Skins </h1>

<h2>We need you !</h2>

<p>If you think you are an artist, we need you to design skins. To know
how to do such a thing, just see the <a href="/vlc/skins-create.html">skin 
creation page.</a> Don't worry, you don't need any programming skills.</p>

<h2>New interface !</h2>

<table style="margin: 0px;">
  <tr valign="middle">
    <td>
<p>VLC has now a skinnable interface. It's only available on Windows
systems and X11 and is experimental. That means it should work on Windows 2000
and linux, and has not yet been tested well on Win9x/WinXP OS.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>How to get it ?</h2>

<p>You can test the skinnable interface in the <a
href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html">last VLC for
Windows release</a>.</p>

<p>To launch VLC with the skin interface:</p>

<ul>

<li>use the special shortcut in the start menu;</li>

<li>or launch VLC with this command line:

<pre style="margin-left: 50px;">
vlc.exe -I skins
</pre>
</li>

<li>or go to the preference menu after launching VLC and click on
the <b>View/Add Interface/skins</b> menu.</li>

</ul>

<p>You need a skin file too; you can download them from the <a
href="/vlc/download-skins.html">skins download page</a>. These
are just testing skins, but if you think you're some kind of
artist, you don't need any programming skills so here is <a
href="/vlc/skins-create.html">how to create your skin</a>.</p>

<h2>How to use it ?</h2>
