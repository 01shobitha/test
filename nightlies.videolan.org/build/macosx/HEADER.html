<h1>VLC media player MacOS X nightly builds</h1>

<p>Due to sorting conventions, the newest builds are at the bottom of the index. Remember to test the <b>latest</b> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nighly builds). Have fun !</p>

<p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <b>#videolan</b> on irc.freenode.net .</p>

<p><b>Because of certain limitations of one of our build machines, the 
current builds are 10.4-only. Compatibility with 10.3.9 will be 
restored 
until the next stable release.</b></p>
