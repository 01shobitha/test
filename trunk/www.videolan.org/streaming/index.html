<h2>Overview of the VideoLAN streaming solution</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN streaming solution includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>The VideoLAN Server (VLS) which can read MPEG videos from various
sources (file, DVD drive, DVB cards and MPEG 2 encoders) and stream them
to the network in unicast or multicast,</li>

<li>The VideoLAN Client (VLC) which can receive, decode and display     
MPEG streams under multiple operating systems.</li>                     

</ul>

<p>This diagram illustrates the VideoLAN solution:</p>

<h2>The VideoLAN Server</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN Server (VLS) can read videos from:</p>

<ul>

  <li>an MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 file stored on a hard drive or on a
  CD,</li>

  <li>a DVD located in a local DVD drive or copied on a hard
  disk,</li>

  <li>a satellite card or a digital terrestial television card,</li>

  <li>an MPEG encoding card ;</li>

</ul>

<p>and stream them over a network to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>one machine (i.e. to one IP address): this is called
  <i>unicast</i> ;</li>

  <li>a dynamic group of machines that the clients can join or leave
  (i.e. to a multicast IP address): this is called
  <i>multicast</i>.</li>

</ul>

<p>

A Pentium 100 MHz with 32 MB of memory should be enough to send one
stream on the network. When streaming a lot of videos stored on a
hard drive, the actual limitation is not the processor but the hard
drive and the network connection.

</p>

<p>

VLS works under Linux and Windows, but only the Linux version
have all the functionalities. The Windows port of VLS can
only stream a video from a file.

</p>


<h2>The VideoLAN Client</h2>

<p>The VideoLAN Client (VLC) works on many platforms: Linux, Windows,  
Mac OS X, BeOS, *BSD, Solaris, Familiar Linux and QNX. It can read      
MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and MPEG 4 / DivX files from a hard disk or a CD-ROM     
drive, read DVDs and VCDs and read from a satellite card. But the most  
important function is that it can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVDs streamed 
over a network.</p>                                                     

<p>VLC requires at least a Pentium 400Mhz with 32MB of RAM.</p>


<h2>The Network</h2>

<p>The network on which you setup the VideoLAN solution can be as small as
one ethernet 10/100Mb switch or hub, and as big as the whole Internet!
The bandwidth needed is:</p>

<ul>

<li>6 to 9 Mbit/s for a DVD,</li>

<li>3 to 4 Mbit/s for an MPEG 2 stream read from a satellite card, a
digital terrestial television card or an MPEG 2 encoding card.</li>

</ul>


<h2>The mini VideoLAN Channel Server</h2>


<p>The mini VideoLAN Channel Server (mini-vlcs) is a channel            
information service tool. It associate multicast addresses and URLs to  
channels, like on a TV. If you install it, the clients won't have to    
type multicast addresses and URLs by hand any more, they will only need
to give the DNS name of the mini VideoLAN Channel Server.</p>
