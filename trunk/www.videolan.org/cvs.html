<h1>CVS repository</h1>

<h2>Basic information</h2>

<p> The anonymous CVS server is called
<code>anoncvs.videolan.org</code>. You can log in as user anonymous,
with an empty password. For instance, to retrieve the <code>vlc</code>
source: </p>

<!-- <object><blockquote><pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan checkout vlc
</pre></blockquote></object> -->
<pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan -z3 checkout -P vlc</pre>

<p> In case you do not have access to CVS (due to strange corporate policies),
CVS tarball snapshots are available (see below). </p>

<h2>Available modules</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>vlc</b>: VideoLAN Client; </li>
  <li><b>vls</b>: VideoLAN Server; </li>
  <li><b>vlms</b>: VideoLAN MiniServer; </li>
  <li><b>network</b>: network tools (VLAN-Server and VLAN-Bridge). </li>
  <li><b>libdvdcss</b>: library for decrypting DVDs, used by VLC and VLS. </li>
  <li><b>libdvbpsi</b>: library for parsing Program Specific Information
from MPEG and DVB streams, used by VLC and VLS. </li>
</ul>

<h2>CVSWeb</h2>

<p> You can <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb">browse the CVS repository</a>
using a nifty tool called CVSWeb. </p>

<h2>VideoLAN Client</h2>

<p> Quite often, VLC development is split between a stable branch and an
unstable branch. The unstable branch is the branch you get by default
with CVS, and in the CVS snapshots. The stable branch is a bug-fix-only
branch. Current stable branch is tagged v0_4_1_branch and 0.4.x versions
come from it. To access it : </p>

<pre>cvs -z 3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.videolan.org:/cvs/videolan checkout -P -r v0_4_1_branch vlc</pre>

<p> The unstable branch is under active development (and patches for new
features should be sent against it) and will lead to the 0.5.x series of
VLC. </p>

<h2>CVS tarball snapshots</h2>

<p> If you have trouble using CVS, you can still use our <a
href="/pub/videolan/vlc/snapshots/">daily VLC CVS snapshots</a>. </p>

<h2>Write access policy</h2>

<p> As usual in opensource projects, you get write access to the CVS
repository when you have shown your skills and ability to write good
patches :) </p>
