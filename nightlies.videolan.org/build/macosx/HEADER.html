<h1>VLC media player Mac OS X PowerPC nightly builds</h1>

<p>Remember to test the <b>latest</b> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nighly builds). Have fun!</p>

<p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <b>#videolan</b> on irc.freenode.net .</p>

<p><h2>Note: VLC requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later</h2></p>
<p>It will not launch on older versions of Mac OS X.</p>
<br />
<p><b>vlc-ppc</b> is the latest VLC snapshot of the unstable branch, compiled in 32 bit mode</p>
<p><b>vlc-stable-ppc</b> is the latest VLC snapshot of the <i>stable</i> branch, compiled in 32 bit mode. At present, this is VLC's 1.2 series.</p>
<br />
<p>Note that we also offer VLCKit, an Objective-C framework to include VLC's functionality in your own applications. For energy saving reasons, no PowerPC-nightlies are provided at this time. It works great on PowerPC though and we regularily provide an Intel version of the framework for you to test.</p>
<p>VLC does not officially support the 64bit PowerPC platform. However, it should work. Feel free to share your experiences.</p>
