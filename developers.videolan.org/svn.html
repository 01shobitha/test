<h1>Subversion repository</h1>

<h2>Basic information</h2>

<p>As of late, VideoLAN is migrating all it's CVS repositories to <a href="
http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> repositories. Subversion (SVN) was built
to be like CVS, but without many of it's faults. This could only be done by
breaking backwards compatibility with CVS. It will be a bit painful at first
for some people but will pay of big time in the end. There used to be scripts
in place that kept our old CVS repositories available to anonymous CVS users,
but these scripts were broken, so the CVS repositories are no longer available.
All developers have to use SVN though. If you had a CVS account
before, but no SVN account yet, then mail the <a href="mailto:vlc-devel@videolan.org">
Developer Mailinglist</a>.
</p>

<p>The SVN server is called
<code>svn.videolan.org</code>.
For instance to retrieve the HEAD vlc source: </p>

<code>
svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/trunk vlc-trunk
</code>

<p>In case you do not have access to the repository for some reason, or if you are
plain lazy, you can download nightly development snapshots (source and binary). See the bottom of the page
</p>

<h2>SVNWeb</h2>

<p>You can <a href="http://developers.videolan.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi">browse the SVN repositories</a> using ViewCVS.</p>


<h2>Development tarball snapshots</h2>

<p>If you have trouble using SVN, you can use our <a
href="http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/snapshots/">daily VLC Development
snapshots</a>. </p>

<h2>VLC nightly builds</h2>

<p style="color: red;">Due to hard drive problems, the server handling vlc's nightly builds is down. We are working to bring it back up as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mac OS X nightly builds are still available here : <a href="http://xserve.via.ecp.fr/~videolan/macosx/">http://xserve.via.ecp.fr/~videolan/macosx/</a><br/>
BeOS nightly builds are still available here : <a href="http://hulk.m0k.org/~titer/videolan/nightly/">http://hulk.m0k.org/~titer/videolan/nightly/</a></p>
<!--
<p>We have <a href="http://www.videolan.org/~videolan/build">nightly builds</a> of VLC for Windows, Mac OS X and BeOS.
</p>-->

<h2>Write access policy</h2>

<p> As usual in opensource projects, you get write access to the CVS
repository when you have shown your skills and ability to write good
patches :) </p>

<h2>Useful SVN tips</h2>

<p>
Here are some SVN usage tips by Sam Hocevar.<br />
A full manual to SVN can be found <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/svnbook/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Repository layout</b></p>

<p>
   There are three directories at the root of a SVN repository: trunk, branches, tags. The
trunk directory is similar to the HEAD branch in CVS: it contains the
most recent vlc tree. The branches and tags directories contains copies
of the trunk at different times.</p>

<p>
   Never download a full svn tree! It would download several hundreds of
megabytes. Instead, only get the trunk directory, like that:
</p>
<pre>
    $ svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/trunk vlc-trunk
</pre><p>
   If you need a specific branch or tag, (eg. branch 0.2), use this:
</p><pre>
    $ svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/branches/0.2 vlc-0.2
</pre><p>
   If you need to know which branches are available, use <code>svn ls</code>:
</p><pre>
    $ svn ls svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/branches/
    0.2
    0.2.92
    0.4.1
    $
</pre><p>
Note that you only need to authenticate yourself when you want to commit something. You do not need to enter a password when you checkout the sources.
</p>

<p><b>Moving files</b></p>
<p>
   No longer create new files from scratch when moving files! Use <code>svn mv</code>:
</p><pre>
    $ svn mv file1 file2
</pre><p>
   It also works for entire directories.
</p>

<p><b>Splitting files</b></p>
<p>
   Do not create a new file from scratch! Instead, copy the old file
using <code>svn cp</code>, remove the old file and modify both newly created files:
</p><pre>
    $ svn cp old new1
    $ svn cp old new2
    $ svn delete old
    [edit new1 and new2]
    $ svn commit
</pre>

<p><b>Getting information about locally modified files</b></p>
<p>
   Use <code>svn status</code> to know which files were modified, deleted or
created. A network connection is not needed for that, do not use <code>svn
update</code> just to know your local modifications.
</p><p>
   <code>svn diff</code> does not require a network connection either if you only
want to show your local modifications.
</p>

<p><b>.cvsignore</b></p>

<p>
   There is no filesystem equivalent to .cvsignore. Instead, metadata
are used. To edit the ignore list for a given directory, use this:
</p><pre>
    $ svn propedit svn:ignore mydirectory
</pre>

<p><b>$Id:</b></p>
<p>
   $Id is no longer automatically taken in account; instead, it has to
be activated in a per-file basis using properties:
</p><pre>
    $ svn propedit svn:keywords myfile
</pre><p>
   Just add "Id" to the list of properties.
</p>
