<h2><a name="basic"/>Basic principles</h2>

<p>A skin (or theme, the two words have almost the same meaning) for VLC is
made of many BMP files (Windows Bitmap format) containing all the images
needed, and of an XML file describing how these images should be displayed, what
happens when the user clicks on a button, etc.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already done skins for other softwares shouldn't
have too many difficulties to understand how all this works.</p>

<h2><a name="bezier"/>Bezier curves</h2>

<p>One cool thing with VLC sliders is that they are not necessarily
rectilinear, but they can follow any Bezier curve. So if you want to have a 
slider moving on a half-circle, or even doing a loop, you can !</p>
<p>This is not the place to explain how these curves work, the only thing
to know is that a Bezier curve can be caracterised by a set of points. Once you
have them (thanks to the graphical utility presented at the end of this file,
for example), you just need to enter the list of abscissas in the 'abs'
attribute and the list of ordinates (in the same order...) in the 'ord' 
attribute.</p>
<p>The separator is the coma. Exemple: abs="2,45,88" ord="50,120,50"</p>
<p>Bezier curves are used for the SliderControl and the PlaylistControl
tags.</p>

<h2><a name="bitmap"/>The bitmaps</h2>

<p>Basically, you need one bitmap file by state of control. For example,
with a image control you'll need 1 image, with a button 2 images (or 3 if you
provide the disabled state). A slider will also need 2, one for the static part
and another for the mobile part. Of course, the same bitmap file can be used
for many controls, provided you want to display the same image!</p>
<p>The bitmap format doesn't allow a transparent color, but in the XML file
you can specify a color that will be considered as transparent wherever it
appears in the bitmap file.</p>

<h2><a name="xml"/>The XML file</h2>

<p>XML is a markup language, like HTML. It won't be explained here any
further, please use Google if you don't know what is XML. You'll see, it's 
rather easy to understand.</p>
<p>The XML file used for the VLC skins follows a predefined DTD. You can
find this DTD in VLC CVS, and its reading is strongly advised, since it contains
most of the default values used for the parameters. A skin that doesn't follow
the DTD with which VLC was compiled won't be loaded by VLC (and it might even
crash it...).</p>

<p>For a better comprehension of what follows, you should have a look at
the DTD (in modules/gui/skin/parser/dkin.dtd) and/or at an example of valid xml
skin (such as modules/gui/skin/skins/default/theme.xml).</p>

<p>OK, let's go for an enumeration of the different tags and their
attributes :</p>

<table class="skins-tag">

magnetism with border of screen: that is to say when the distance between the 
border of the screen and a window is less than this value, the window will 
stick to the border. 0 means no magnetism. Default is "9".

<h2><a name="compression"/>Compression</h2>

<p>Once your skin is finished, instead of keeping many bitmap files and the
XML file, you can compress them in a .tar.gz archive (Winzip and UmtimateZip
can do it perfectly, for example). Before doing so, don't forget to rename your
XML file into "theme.xml", or VLC won't be able to read it...  Then rename
your compressed file with the .vlt extension and... that's all! VLC can load
directly skins with the .vlt extension.</p>

<h2><a name="tools"/>Tools and advice</h2>

<p>To generate easily Bezier curves, you can use the <a
href="/vlc/skins/VLC-curve-maker.exe">curve-maker</a>. Basically,
you add and remove points at will, and you can move them to see how the
curve evolves. When you have reached the perfect curve, you just have
to copy-paste the list ob abscisses and ordinates in the 'abs' and 'ord'
attributes of your SliderControl or PlaylistControl. The curve-maker
also allows to load a bitmap, this could be useful if you want to follow a
specific pattern of a slider, for example.</p>

<p>When you are creating your skin, you may want to see the VLC messages
where some errors are logged. For this, open a dos window, go to the
directory where VLC is installed, and type "vlc -I skin -v --extraintf logger".
This should open VLC and a log window (what's more, the logs should be
saved in a file called vlc-log.txt). The interesting lines are those with "skin
interface"...</p>

<p>For the Bitmap tags, don't use absolute paths but relative paths
(they are relative to the XML file directory), so that your skin can be reused
by anybody without a particular file structure.</p>

<p>To fully use the possibilities given, you should look at how other
skins are made, it's often very useful.</p>
