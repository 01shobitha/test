<h1>Contacting the VideoLAN team</h1>

<p> User questions can be sent to the appropriate <i>English-speaking</i>
mailing-lists: </p>

<ul>

  <li> <a href="mailto:streaming@videolan.org">streaming@videolan.org</a> for specific questions about the streaming solution. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to contact the French team of the Ecole                  
Centrale Paris, about partnerships for example, please write to <a             
href="mailto:videolan@videolan.org">videolan@videolan.org</a> in       
French or English.</p>                                                  

<p>If you want to redistribute some VideoLAN software (VLC,             
VLS...) in a magazine for example, you don't need to ask us             
the permission ! You can distribute an original or a modified           
version as long as you comply with its license terms, i.e. the <a       
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public          
License Version 2</a>. The easiest way to conform to this licence       
is to accompany the software with its sources. For example, if          
you plan to distribute a binary version of VLC on a CD, you             
should also include on the same CD all the files listed on the <a       
href="/vlc/download-sources.html">VLC source code page</a>.</p>        

<p>In case you write an article about VideoLAN, we would be very glad to
have a copy of it to add to our press book. You can send us the article
at the following address :</p>
