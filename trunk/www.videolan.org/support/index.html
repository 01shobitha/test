<h1>User support for VideoLAN software</h1>

<p>VideoLAN is free software, so the user support is provided by the
VideoLAN user and developper community.</p>

<h2>The mailing-lists</h2>

<p>The user mailing-lists are dedicated to user support and
announces for VideoLAN releases and events. Please see the <a
href="lists.html">mailing-lists</a> page to subscribe, unsubscribe,
consult the archives and read about the rules and restrictions.</p>

<h2>IRC</h2>

<p>You can talk with other users and developers on the IRC:</p>

<ul>

<li>IRC network: <code>irc.freenode.net</code> (former OpenProjects
network)</li>

<li>Channel: <code>#videolan</code>

</ul>

<p>For that, you can use your own IRC client or the <a
href="/cgi-bin/irc/irc.cgi">IRCWeb</a> interface.</p>

<h2>The bug tracking system</h2>

<p>VideoLAN has recently set up a <a
href="http://bugzilla.videolan.org">bug tracking system</a> based on
Bugzilla. With this system, users can report bugs and other users and
developers can comment on it, modify it, give hints or close it when
the bug has been killed.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, check if it has already been reported or open a
new bug if it hasn't.</p>
