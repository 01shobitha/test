<h1>VLC media player Mac OS X Intel nightly builds</h1>

<p>Remember to test the <b>latest</b> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nightly builds). Have fun!</p>

<p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <b>#videolan</b> on irc.freenode.net .</p>

<p><h2>Note: VLC's nightly builds for Intel require Mac OS X 10.6 or later</h2></p>
<p>It will not launch on older releases. We recommend you to keep your Mac OS X installation up-to-date and to install Apple's updates. This will also improve your VLC usage experience.<br>VLC's official releases still support Mac OS X 10.5.</p>
<br />
<p>What's the stable branch? That's currently VLC's 1.2 series. We no longer provide nightly builds for VLC 1.1.x.</p>
