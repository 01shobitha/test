<h1>VLC media player nightly builds for macOS</h1>

<p>Remember to test the <b>latest</b> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nightly builds). Have fun!</p>

<p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <b>#videolan</b> on irc.freenode.net .</p>

<p><h2>Note: VLC's nightly builds require Mac OS X 10.7 or later</h2></p>
<p>It will not launch on older releases. We recommend you to keep your Mac OS X installation up-to-date and to install Apple's updates. This will also improve your VLC usage experience.</p>
<p>Note that nightly builds for macOS are not signed with our GateKeeper certificate. Therefore, you need to right-click on the application to select "Open" to launch them for the first time after download.</p>
<br />
<p>What's the stable branch? That's currently VLC's 2.2 series. We no longer provide nightly builds for VLC 1.1.x, 2.0.x or 2.1.x.</p>
<br />
<p><b>vlc-<i>version</i>-x86_64 </b> is the latest VLC snapshot compiled in <i>64</i> bit mode.</p>
