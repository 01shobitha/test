<h1> VLC media player for Mac OS X </h1>

<h2>Looking for more Mac OS X developers</h2>
<p> We are currently looking for more developers for the Mac OS X port of VLC. Needed skills are C-knowledge and some experience in programming for Mac OS X by using Cocoa and Xcode. Know-how on programming A/V applications will probably make the work easier for you, but is not essential.</p><p>At present, one of our goals is to create a new more user-friendly preferences-window. Thus, if you have experience on this topic, any help will be appreciated, but there are also other subjects where we would be happy about another helping hand.</p><p>If you would like to join the project, feel free to send us an e-mail to the <a href="http://developers.videolan.org/lists.html">vlc-devel mailing list</a> or to contact us through our <a href="http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=3675&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=">forum</a>. </p>

<h2>Latest Mac OS X package (0.8.1)</h2>

<p><b>Note:</b> There is not, and there will never be, a version for Mac OS 9.</p>

<ul>
<?php pkgitem("0.8.1/macosx","vlc-0.8.1.dmg","vlc"); ?> (Requires Mac OS X 10.2 or 10.3)
</ul>
<ul>  
<?php pkgitem("0.7.0/macosx","vlc-0.7.0.dmg","vlc"); ?> (Last version for Mac OS X 10.1)
</ul>

<p> VLC for Mac OS X is distributed as a disk image. Download the
<code>.dmg</code> file, open it, and copy it to your hard drive
(for instance the <code>/Applications</code> folder). Open VLC by
double-clicking on it. </p>
<!--
<h2>Mac OS X beta package (0.8.0-test2)</h2>

<p>This is the beta package for the next version: 0.8.0</p>

<ul>
 <?php pkgitemdev( "vlc-0.8.0-test2/macosx" , "vlc-0.8.0-test2.dmg"); ?>
</ul>
-->
<h2>Older versions</h2>

<p> Older versions can be found by browsing our FTP site :</p>
<ul> <?php mirrordir("vlc"); ?> </ul>

<h2>Source code</h2>
