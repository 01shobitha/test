<sect1><title>What is the VideoLAN project ?</title>

<para>

VideoLAN is a complete software solution for video streaming, developed
by students at the <ulink url="http://www.ecp.fr">Ecole Centrale
Paris</ulink> and developers from all over the world, under the
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</ulink> (GPL). It is designed to stream MPEG videos on high
bandwidth networks.

</para>

<para>

The VideoLAN solution includes :

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>a server, the VideoLAN Server (vls), which can take MPEG
videos from various sources (file, DVD drive, DVB cards and MPEG 2
encoders) and sends them to the network in unicast or multicast,</para>

<listitem><para>a client, the VideoLAN Client (vlc), which can receive,
decode and display MPEG streams under multiple Operating Systems.</para>

</itemizedlist>

<para>

Here is an illustration of the complete VideoLAN solution :

<sect1><title>The documentation of the project</title>

<para>

There are three main documents :

</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/videolan-quickstart/">VideoLAN
Quickstart</ulink>. This document will give you a quick overview of
the VideoLAN solution. It will learn you basic use of the VideoLAN Client, the
VideoLAN Server, and the Video On Demand solution.</para>

<listitem><para>the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/videolan-howto/">VideoLAN
HOWTO</ulink>. This document is the complete guide of the VideoLAN Solution. It will give you the complete documentation for the VideoLAN Server, the VideoLAN Channel Server, and the different tools.</para>

<listitem><para>the <ulink

guide</ulink>. This document only focuses  on the VideoLAN Client. It is
the complete documentation of this software.</para>

<simplesect><title>VideoLAN Client</title>

<para>

The VideoLAN Client (vlc) works on many platforms : Linux, Windows, Mac
OS X, BeOS, *BSD, Solaris, iPaq, QNX. It can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and
MPEG 4 / DivX files from a hard disk or a CD-ROM drive, read DVDs and
VCDs and read from a satellite card. But the most important function
is that it can read MPEG 1, MPEG 2 and DVDs streamed over a network. Vlc
requires at least a Pentium 400Mhz with 32MB of RAM.

</para>

<note><para>Vlc doesn't work on Mac OS 9, and will
probably never do.</para></note>

<simplesect><title>VideoLAN Server</title>

<para>

The VideoLAN Server (vls) can read videos from :

</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>an MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 file stored on a hard drive or on a
CD,</para>
<listitem><para>a DVD located in a local DVD drive or copied on a hard
disk,</para>
<listitem><para>a satellite card or a digital terrestial television card,</para>
<listitem><para>an MPEG encoding card ;</para>
</itemizedlist>

<para>and stream it over a network to :</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>one machine (i.e. to one IP address) : this is called
<emphasis>unicast</emphasis> ;</para>

<listitem><para>every   machines   on   a   subnet:   this   is   called
<emphasis>broadcast</emphasis> ; </para>

<listitem><para>a dynamic group of machines that the clients can join or leave
(i.e. to a multicast IP address) : this is called
<emphasis>multicast</emphasis>.</para>

</itemizedlist>

<para>

A Pentium 100 MHz with 32 MB of memory should be enough to send one
stream on the network. When streaming a lot of videos stored on a
hard drive, the actual limitation is not the processor but the hard
drive and the network connection.

</para>

<para>

Vls works under Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. Currently, the Windows
port of vls is only able to stream a video from a file (not from a DVD
drive).

If you have problems using VideoLAN, and if you don't find the
answer to your problems in the documentation, please look at the
<ulink url="http://www.via.ecp.fr/ml/videolan">online archive of the
mailing-lists</ulink>. There are two English-speaking mailing-lists for
the users :
