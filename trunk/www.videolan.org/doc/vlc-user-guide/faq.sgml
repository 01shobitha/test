 <question><para>How do I read a DVD?</para></question>
 <answer><para>Just launch vlc and use the "open disc" command from the graphical
interface. In case of trouble, you may want to use the command line
interface:</para>

<question><para>How do I read an encrypted DVD?</para></question>
<answer><para>
It's exactly the same as for a normal DVD. You will need write access to
/dev/dvd, because of the key negociation process.
</para><para>
If you compiled your VLC by hand, please bear in mind that you also need
to install libdvdcss. It can be downloaded from the VideoLAN website. It
used to be distributed in the same package as VLC, but now you must install
them seperately.

<qandaentry><question><para>
VLC eats my buffer cache, how to I use raw device?</para></question><answer>

<para>If you don't know what is a raw device, don't even read this answer :-).
There is an experimental support for raw devices in libdvdcss. It needs
that you set up a raw device pointing to your DVD device (under Linux,
use the "raw" utility). Then pass the raw device as second argument, for
instance:</para>
<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc dvd:/dev/dvd@/dev/raw0</userinput></screen>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>How do I use VLC as a client for VLS/VLMS streaming?</para></question><answer>

<para>First you must set up a VLS or VLMS stream. Please refer to the
documentation of these programs. Then start VLC:</para>
<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc udp:</userinput></screen>

<para>You shouldn't need any option. If you're paranoid and want to control
everything, here is the exact syntax:</para>
<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc udp:[&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;server port&gt;]][@[&lt;bind address&gt;][:&lt;bind port&gt;]]</userinput></screen>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>How do I uninstall / reinstall VLC?</para></question><answer>

<para>Why would you want to?  ;)</para>

<para>If you're using a source distribution of VLC, for example a tarball or
the CVS, then you have probably used "make install" to install the
compiled VLC.  To remove it just "make uninstall".  If you want to
install a newer version than the currently installed one, you should
first uninstall the first one.  If you deleted the original source tree,
a "make uninstall" in the newer tree should still work.</para>

<para>For binary packages, remove old packages first and install the new ones
(normally this should be handled automagically by your sytem).</para>

<qandaentry><question><para>How can I save my VLC configuration?</para></question><answer>

<para>Currently, the only  way to save the configuration  options in VLC
is through the  preferences menu in one of the  graphical user interface
plugins.</para> </answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>Where does VLC store it's config file?</para></question><answer>

<para>Currently, a config file is created on a per user basis (there
is no global configuration file). If you modify the available options
in VLC and save the new configuration, then a configuration file will
be created in your user directory. The precise location of this file
depends on the Operating System you are running:</para> 
<itemizedlist><listitem><para>UniX
(linux, etc...): <filename>~/.videolan/vlcrc</filename></para></listitem>

<qandadiv><title>Troubleshooting</title>

<qandaentry><question><para>When I start vlc, I don't have any interface coming...</para></question><answer>

<para>
If you installed a binary package, make sure you also installed an
interface package such as vlc-gtk or vlc-qt. If you installed from
source, make sure the development package for gtk or qt is correctly
installed (often gtk-dev or gtk-devel) and recompile.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>Clicking on "disc" in the interface doesn't do anything</para></question><answer>

<para>
Wait a few seconds. Key cracking can take much time on some discs. If it
still doesn't work, you can have a more verbose output using <command>vlc -vvvvv</command>.
Here are a few things to check for:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Did you install libdvdcss ?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Do you have write access to your DVD device? For instance:
	(Under Unix/Linux) <command>chmod 666 /dev/hdc</command> </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Does your kernel log contain line about your DVD device?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If you are running Unix/Linux, do you have a link from /dev/dvd to your real DVD device? For instance</para>
<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>ln -s hdc /dev/dvd</userinput></screen></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>The video runs but the picture is distorted...</para></question><answer>
<para>There is probably a problem with the output layer. There are several
ways of troubleshooting it. First, try with another output plug-in, for
instance:</para>
<screen><prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc --vout sdl</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt><userinput>vlc --vout x11</userinput></screen>

<para>Second, change your screen depth and/or definition. It quite often helps.
Lastly, if running Unix with a X11 Server, have a look at your XFree86 video driver (nVidia for instance
releases optimized drivers for its boards).</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>Video is choppy...</para></question><answer>

<para>Your system is too slow to decode all pictures. It might be that your
CPU basically isn't fast enough. It can also be that the subsystem is
misconfigured/misdriven, this happens for example under Redhat. Here are
some elements to improve speed:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Turn on DMA on your DVD device, for instance</para>
<screen><prompt>Under Linux:      % </prompt><userinput>hdparm -X34 -d1 /dev/dvd</userinput></screen>

<para>Under Windows,  go to  the <emphasis>System</emphasis>  section of
the control  panel, and go to  the <emphasis>Hardware manager</emphasis>
(it is sometimes in a separate tab, and sometimes, you have to go to the
<emphasis>Advanced</emphasis> tab.  Then, righ-click on your  DVD player,
and check the <emphasis>DMA</emphasis> checkbox</para></listitem>

<qandaentry><question><para>Audio and video are out of sync.</para></question><answer>
<para>This is not normal. Try using another output plug-in (for instance <command>--aout oss</command>),
kill esd or artsd if they are running... This is a known problem and
is being investigated.</para>

<qandaentry><question><para>I have no image under DirectX.</para></question><answer>

<para>Check that your video card drivers are in their latest version and that
your DirectX is up-to-date.</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>VLC crashes.</para></question><answer>

<para>Increase the verbosity level (either  in the preferences or with a
<emphasis>-vvvv</emphasis> command-line  option) and  look at  the debug
messages (on the terminal or in the Messages window).</para>

<para>If you cannot solve your  problem, don't hesitate to subscribe the
<emphasis>vlc@videolan.org</emphasis>  mailing  list  and send  us  your
question. Don't forget to give the debug messages, as this could help us
trying to solve your problem</para>

<qandaentry><question><para>I'm stuck with option xxx, how do I reset options?</para></question><answer>

<para>Under Unix systems, remove your <filename>~/.videolan/vlcrc</filename>.
Under Windows, remove the <filename>vlcrc</filename> file,
in the <filename>videolan</filename> subfolder of your <filename>Application Data</filename> (usually found in <filename>C:\Documents and Settings\your_name</filename> directory ).
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>I don't have access to the GUI anymore.</para></question><answer>

<para>If you change the default interface module in the preferences menu
to a non GUI module (ie. to  a command line interface) and then save the
configuration, the only way to get VLC to  show a GUI again is to run it
directly from the command line.</para>

<para> For instance on Windows, you need to open a dos command box, go
to the directory where you installed VLC (usually <filename>c:\Program
Files\VideoLAN\VideoLAN Client</filename>) and then type </para>

<screen><prompt>C:\path_to_vlc\:</prompt><userinput>vlc --intf win32</userinput></screen>

<para>You will then be able to modify the configuration again and save
it.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>I have just upgraded to VLC 0.4.5, and now I don't have any sound
with the streams coming from the VLS !</para></question><answer>

<para>This is a known problem. VLC 0.4.5 and later are now compliant to general
usage regarding A/52 sound, and the new behavior is incompatible with the
previous one. VLS version 0.4.0 and later now fixes this problem. If, for
a reason or another, you wish to keep VLS 0.3.3, you can still read those
streams if you launch VLC (0.4.5 or later) with <filename> --vls-backwards-compat</filename></para>
</answer></qandaentry>
<qandaentry><question><para>NO VIDEO!! or NO AUDIO !!</para></question><answer>


<para>DON'T PANIC! Use the verbose mode of vlc to search the problem, you may
either set the verbosity option in the interface preferences or use
the "-vvv" command line switch to increase the number of report/error
messages given by vlc. If you are not using a terminal, use the Messages
window in the View menu.</para>

<qandaentry><question><para>May I use the VideoLAN logo?</para></question><answer>

<para>You may use the VideoLAN logo using the following copyright:</para>

<para>  Copyright (c) 1996-2002 VideoLAN. This logo or a modified version
  may be used or modified by anyone to refer to the VideoLAN project
  or any product developed by the VideoLAN team, but does not indicate
  endorsement by the project.</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>May I reditribute VLC?</para></question><answer>


<para>You may distribute an original or modified version of VideoLAN as long
as you conform to the terms of its license. It is the GNU General Public
License Version 2 (referred herein as GPL), and it is in the file named
COPYING in our products.</para>

<para>The simpliest way to conform to the GPL is to accompany the product you
want to distribute with its sources. For example, if you plan to
distribute the binary version in its 0.4.6 version you should include:
</para>

<para>   http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.4.6/vlc-0.4.6.tar.gz</para>
<para>   http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/0.4.6/contrib/</para>

<para>You don't need to bother explaining where the sources are, but the
sources have to share the same media as the products.</para>

<para>They are other ways to conform to the GPL, but this should be the
simplest because it does not rely on a contract.</para>

<para>There is one additional issue you need to take care of. The VLC
binary from our website can also read encrypted DVDs with the help of
the libdvdcss library. Its use is controversial in a few countries
such as the United States because of a law called the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act). If you are unsure about the legality of using and distributing this library in
your country, please consult your lawyer.</para>

<qandadiv><title>Miscellaneous</title>

<qandaentry><question><para>How may I help your project?</para></question><answer>

<para>You might either contribute time, material, or money. We are also always
needing some translators. You will find all information you need in 
<ulink url="http://videolan.org/contribute.html"> our "contribute" page</ulink>
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>Why  are  your  mailing-lists  and  your  website  in
english?</para></question>
<answer>
<para>VideoLAN's developers come from all around the world and english is
the only language they can use to communicate together. Although great
care is given to the translation of our softwares in various languages,
maintaining translations of our documentation and website costs too much
time than we can afford.
