<h1>Compile VLC on Mac OS X</h1>

<p>Compiling VLC on Mac OS X is different from normal linux compiling and OS X compiling. We do not use Project Builder to compile, but a simple ./configure and then make isn't enough either. The instructions below are always for the current release.<p>

<p>If you compile from CVS then please remember that CVS can often be in an unstable state. If you wish to develop or test please join the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/support/lists.html">vlc-devel mailinglist.</a>.<br />
Don't put any of the non released test binaries or cvs-compiles on software sites or on userforums. We have had bad experiences with this before and we do not appreciate it.</p>

<p>Please follow these steps for compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install de Mac OSX developer tools from the Developer Tools CD, or get them <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html">online</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.videolan.org/pub/videolan/devtools/macosx-usr-local.tar.bz2">Download</a> the usr/local/ archive from Christophe Massiot. You will need to install all these files in your own /usr/local archive. Uncompress them and use the terminal and sudo to copy them to that location. If you are already lost, then you probably have no business compiling VLC, i.e. you are not a developer or not a good tester.</li> 
<li>Modify your .cshrc and add the line:<br />
<code>set path = ( /usr/local/bin $path )</code></li>
<li>If you have fink, either disable it by commenting the line
<code>#source /sw/bin/init.csh</code>
or modify the /sw/bin/init.csh to add /sw/bin path AFTER $path</li>
<li>Use ranlib on every new library by executing the following line in the Terminal:<br />
<code>find /usr/local/lib -name "lib*.a" -exec ranlib {} \;</code>
<li>Download the source code (use cvs or download the archive)</li>
<li>cd to the source directory</li>
<li>If you use CVS, then run ./bootstrap</li>
<li>run ./configure. The following is suggested:<br /><code>./configure --disable-x11 --disable-xvideo --disable-gtk --disable-sdl --enable-ffmpeg --with-ffmpeg-mp3lame --enable-mad --enable-libdvbpsi --enable-a52 --enable-dvdplay --enable-faad --enable-vorbis --enable-ogg --enable-theora --enable-faac --enable-mkv --enable-freetype --disable-cddax --disable-vcdx --enable-debug</code></li>
<li>make</li>
</ul>
