<h1> <a href="/">VideoLAN</a> / Support </h1>

<p>VideoLAN is free software, so the user support is provided by the
VideoLAN user and developer community.</p>

<? h2("The bug tracking system"); ?>

<p>VideoLAN has recently set up a <a href="http://bugzilla.videolan.org">bug
tracking system</a> based on Bugzilla. With this system, users can report bugs
and other users and developers can comment on it, modify it, give hints or
close it when the bug has been killed.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, check whether it has already been reported and open a
new bug if it hasn't.</p>

<? h2("The mailing-lists"); ?>

<p>The user mailing-lists are dedicated to user support and
announces for VideoLAN releases and events. Please see the <a
href="lists.html">mailing-lists</a> page to subscribe, unsubscribe,
consult the archives and read about the rules and restrictions.</p>

<? h2("IRC"); ?>

<p> If you want more real-time stuff, you can meet many VideoLAN developers
and users on IRC: </p>

<ul>
  <li>IRC network: <code>irc.freenode.net</code></li>
  <li>Channel: <code>#videolan</code></li>
</ul>

<p> You can connect with any IRC client. If you cannot connect from your
place, try the web-based <a href="/cgi-bin/irc/irc.cgi">IRCWeb</a> interface.
