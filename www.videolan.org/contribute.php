<h1> How to contribute to VideoLAN </h1>

<h2>Contribute time</h2>

<p> If you have time and programming skills, you                        
can help us develop the software. Read the <a                           
href="/developers/">developer documentations</a>,    
subscribe to the <a href="/support/lists.html">mailing-lists</a>, have  
a look at the <a href="http://trac.videolan.org/">bug-tracking      
system</a>, join the <a href="/support/">IRC channel</a> and start to   
code! Send your code to the developer mailing-lists under the form of   
patches for the current <a href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Git">
Version Controlled Sources</a>. If you often make good contributions, the  
VideoLAN team will give you a <a href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Git">
Git</a> write account. </p>                   

<p> If you have time but no programming skills, you can help with the   
documentation, the <a href="/developers/i18n/">translation</a> of the VLC interface and the VideoLAN    
documentation, the packaging, the tests before the releases, answer the 
questions in the user mailing-lists if you can, etc... </p>             

<h2>Contribute materials</h2>

<p> Your particular DVD does not work with VLC or VLS? VLC does not like your
VCD or SVCD? You have a satellite card or an MPEG encoding card that is not
supported by VideoLAN? </p>

<p> You can donate it to the developers at the École Centrale and it may
motivate them to work on your suggestion! In any case, you do not have any
warranty that your wish will be taken into account. </p>

<p> If you want to donate materials, please write to <a
href="mailto:videolan@REMOVETHIS@videolan.org">videolan - at - videolan.org</a> so that we can
tell you if we are interested and give you our snail-mail address. </p>
