<? h2("May 2002 - The new network and the new test campaign at the Ecole Centrale"); ?>

<p><a href="http://www.via.ecp.fr/">VIA Centrale Réseaux</a>, the        
association which manages the network of the student residence of the   
<a href="http://www.ecp.fr/">Ecole Centrale Paris</a>, has set up a      
brand new network from Extreme Networks. It is a full multicast and     
full layer 3 network with a multi Ethernet Gigabit backbone and 100     
Mbit/s switches on the periphery.</p>

<p>The VideoLAN team has launched a new test campaign on this network.  
One thousand students take part in the test campaign. They can          
choose to view one of the 12 channels and switch from one to another    
instantly. For the first day of the test campaign, we organised a       
show at the Ecole Centrale for the students with an image wall 
!</p>

<? h2("April 2002 - Unpacking the IBM Thinkpad"); ?>

<p>We eventually received the IBM Thinkpad as a reward for the         
<a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/linux/news/ilsc.shtml">IBM Linux
Challenge</a>. VideoLAN is one of the 25 winners of the IBM Linux       
Challenge for opensource projects developed by university students. The 
Thinkpad is a T23: Pentium 1.13 Ghz, 128 Mbit of RAM, 30 Gbit hard     
drive, DVD player, modem and Ethernet card. It was shipped with Windows 
XP...! Its name is <b>Velix</b>. It will be used by the developers of 
the Ecole Centrale to develop and test the solution and also for the    
events that we organise around VideoLAN.</p>
