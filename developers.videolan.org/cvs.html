<h1>CVS repository</h1>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> VideoLAN is switching from CVS to <a href="
http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>. Read more about it on our <a href="
svn.html">SVN page</a>.
Only the the anonymous server is still working, it is being kept in sync with SVN.
<b>AT THE MOMENT CVS IS NOT IN SYNC WITH SVN AND IT IS PARTIALLY BROKEN.</b>
</p>

<h2>Basic information</h2>

<p> The anonymous CVS server is called
<code>anoncvs.videolan.org</code>. You can log in as user anonymous,
with an empty password. For instance, to retrieve the <code>vlc</code>
source: </p>

<pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan login
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan -z3 checkout -P vlc</pre>

<p> In case you do not have access to CVS (due to strange corporate policies which resulted in firewalls),
CVS tarball snapshots are available (see below). </p>
