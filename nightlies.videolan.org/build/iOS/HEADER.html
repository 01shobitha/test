<h1>MobileVLCKit iOS nightly builds for ARMv7, ARMv7s, AArch64, x86_64 and i686</h1>

<p>Remember to test the <b>latest</b> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nightly builds). Have fun!</p>

<p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <b>#videolan</b> on irc.freenode.net .</p>

<p><h2>Note: MobileVLCKit's nightly builds for iOS require iOS 7 or later as well as Xcode 7.3 or later</h2></p>
<p>The static framework will not work on earlier releases of iOS. Linking with libc++ instead of libstdc++ is required.</p>
