<P>You can choose either to take the latest release, or a CVS source. Note that
CVS snapshots may be broken, although we do our best to prevent this from
happening.</P>
<P>From here, you have to be a little experienced, even more if you want to use
the cvs.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc5.1">Getting an archive</A>
</H2>

<P>You have guessed it, the first thing to do is to get the source.
Until there, everyone should understand :)</P>
<H3>Web site</H3>

<P>Source packages can be found in the "tarballs" section of the download page :
<A HREF="http://www.videolan.org/download.html">http://www.videolan.org/dowload.html</A>.</P>
<P>CVS snapshots are available from the address : 
<A HREF="http://www.videolan.org/packages/snapshots/">http://www.videolan.org/packages/snapshots/</A>.</P>
<P>Then untar the archive :
<PRE>
     tar xzf vlc-x-x-x.tar.gz
    
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>Directly from CVS</H3>

<P> 
<A NAME="cvs"></A> 
First log in as user anonymous with an empty password :
<PRE>
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan login
    
</PRE>

Then retrieve the repository :
<PRE>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan -z3 checkout vlc
   
</PRE>
</P>
<H3>libdvdcss</H3>

<P>To compile vlc with dvd support, you need to get and install libdvdcss.</P>
<P>It is available for download here : 
<A HREF="http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html">http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html</A></P>
<P>Decompress the tarball in a directory of your choice and build it :
<PRE>
    tar -xvzf libdvdcss-x.x.x.tar.gz
    cd libdvdcss-x.x.x
    ./configure
    make
    [as root] make install
   
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You can also find binaries packages for many distributions.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc5.2">Building the program</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="compile"></A> 
Go into the vlc directory and run the configure script :
<PRE>
    ./configure
   
</PRE>

If you want to enable options, you may add "--enable-option" 
to the previous line.
For example, to build with the xvideo extension, and alsa support, 
you should type :
<PRE>
    ./configure --enable-xvideo --enable-alsa
    
</PRE>

To get the list of the available options, and know if they are 
enabled by default,
you can try :
<PRE>
    ./configure --help
   
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Also have a look on the 
<A HREF="vlc-howto-6.html#modules">following modules     descriptions</A>.</P>
<P>A very typical installation, on a XFree 4.1 system, recent video card, with 
gnome, is :
<PRE>
    ./configure --enable-esd --enable-gnome
   
</PRE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc5.3">Plugins, builtins ...</A>
</H2>

<P>The configure script should create a Makefile.opts file, which you can edit and modify.
Indeed you can chose to have features (as esd support, for example) built as plugins
or inside the program.</P>
<P>If you build a feature as a plugin, it can lead to a little loss of performance.
It you build it inside the code, it'll enlarge a bit the size of the executable.</P>
<P>When you're done with Makefile.opts (which also works if you leave it 
untouched), just 
type:
<PRE>
    make
    
</PRE>

It should compile without any error. If there are, please check you 
have the required libraries 
installed on your system, as the configure script can't check them all.</P>
<P>When you're done with it, as root, type :
<PRE>
    make install
   
</PRE>

if you wish to have vlc fully installed on your system. If you prefer 
to keep in in the 
current directory, you may skip the "make install". You'll then have 
to cd into the vlc 
directory and type "./vlc" instead of just typing vlc.</P>
