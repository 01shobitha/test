<h1>VLC media player MacOS X nightly builds</h1>

<p>Remember to test the <b>latest</b> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nighly builds). Have fun !</p>

<p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <b>#videolan</b> on irc.freenode.net .</p>

<p><b>Note: VLC 0.9.0 (the development branch shown here) will be the first release, which does not support Mac OS X 10.3.x. Starting with this new version,
VLC media player requires Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger or Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. It will not launch on older releases.<br/>
VLC's 0.8.6 series remains the last branch supporting Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.<br/>
We decided to drop the support because of the low usage of this older release (only about 10 per cent of all Mac users) and the huge potential of Tiger and Leopard,
which will allow us to provide an even better VLC.</b></p>
