<sect1><title>Launching VLS</title>

<para>If you want to use the telnet interface, running VLS is
very easy: just type <command>vls</command> in a shell console,
and that's all. Running <command>vlsd</command> will start VLS
as a daemon and will detach itself from the launching shell.
Remember that VLS will try to load its configuration file
(<filename>vls.cfg</filename>) from the current directory, and if
there is no <filename>vls.cfg</filename> there, it will try to load it
from <filename>SYSCONF_DIR/etc/videolan</filename> (see section <xref
linkend="config" endterm="tconfig"/>).</para>

<caution><para>If your log file is <filename>vls.log</filename> as in
the example, VLS will need write access in the current directory, or you
will see something like:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>
*** Exception *** in copy constructor (0xbffffc98, copy of 0x80e30a8)
Unable to open the log file "vls.log": Error: Could not open file 'vls.log':
Permission denied
</computeroutput></screen>

<para>Remember also that you must be root when using the "Interface"
option in <filename>vls.cfg</filename>.</para>

</caution>

<para>If everything is right, you will see something like:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>
VideoLAN Server v 0.5.3 (Jun  6 2003) - (c)1999-2003 VideoLAN

</computeroutput></screen>

<para>What you can see on the screen (stderr) is exactly what goes in
the log file <filename>vls.log</filename>.</para>

<para>When VLS has been successfully started, it doesn't take any command from
its standard input, so you can put it into background (you can use the
<emphasis>screen</emphasis> utility to do that).</para>

<para>On the other hand, if you want to use the command line interface,
please see the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/">VideoLAN
HOWTO</ulink>.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Using the telnet interface</title>

<para>After VLS has been launched, it opens a telnet server (on the port
9999 by default). You can connect to this server with the following
command:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>telnet localhost 9999</userinput>
</screen>

<para>You should see something like:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to vls.
Escape character is '^]'.

Videolan Server Administration System

Login:
</computeroutput></screen>

<para>Then you must authenticate with a login/password pair defined
in <filename>vls.cfg</filename>. When you have been successfully
authenticated, you should see a prompt like:</para>


<screen><computeroutput>
admin@vls>
</computeroutput>></screen>

<para>Then you can type some commands, which are explained in the next
paragraph. To log out, type <command>logout</command> after the telnet
prompt.</para>
