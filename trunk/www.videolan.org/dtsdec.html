<h1>dtsdec/libdts - a free DTS Coherent Acoustics decoder</h1>

<p>libdts is a free library for decoding DTS Coherent Acoustics streams. The code is written by <a href="mailto:gbazin@videolan.org">Gildas Bazin</a> and was based on the <a href="http://liba52.sourceforge.net/">a52dec</a> project. It is released under the terms of the GPL license.</p>

<p>The DTS Coherent Acoustics standard (ETSI 102 114 v1.2.1), as published by the ETSI, is available <a href="http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp">here</a> (look for DTS Coherent Acoustics).</p>

<h2>Development status</h2>

<h3>BIG FAT WARNING: libdts is still in early development stage so don't expect too much of it</h3>

<p>Right now, I am concentrating on finishing the implementation of the core part or the specification.</p>

<p>A few things are still lacking there but they should mainly affect low-bitrate DTS streams which don't seem that common anyway (some of the missing things are: Joint channels coding, High frequencies VQ, etc...).</p>

<p>There might also be quality issues, but for some early code it does seem pretty decent to me.</p>

<h2>Getting libdts</h2>

<p>Current release is <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/dtsdec/0.0.1/dtsdec-0.0.1.tar.gz">dtsdec-0.0.1.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>The latest libdts and dtsdec source code can always be found by anonymous SVN repository:</p>

<p># svn co svn://svn.zoy.org/dtsdec</p>

<h2>Where to find DTS Coherent Acoustics samples</h2>

<p>Some very good samples are available on the <a href="http://www.sr.se/multikanal/english/e_index.stm">swedish radio website</a>.</p>
