<h1>The VideoLAN website gets a new home</h1>

<p>
VideoLAN is the software development project behind the open-source
VLC&nbsp;media&nbsp;player (VLC), a cross-platform media player and
streaming solution, some widely used audio/video encoding/decoding
and decryption open-source libraries, and IP network streaming tools.
</p>
<p>
Ever since its inception in 1996 by visionary students, the project has
been hosted on the campus of the &Eacute;cole Centrale Paris (ECP),
a famous French engineering university (&quot;Grande &Eacute;cole&quot;).
The project eventually went open-source in early 2001.
From then on, contributors from all over the world started contributing,
and VLC was ported to Windows within about 3 months.
</p>
<p>
As VLC popularity rose, so did the bandwidth usage of our main web server.
We did upgrade our web server since then (thanks to HP and IBM), and the
campus network connection from 10 to 100&nbsp;Mbps... still insufficent,
but already more than the ECP could afford.
</p>
<p>
In the perceived interest of our users and contributors, we have hence
decided to move from our historical <em>home</em> to a new provider.
As of now, our main server will be hosted by French ISP Free S.A.S.
which we thank a lot for its generous offer and its precious help.
