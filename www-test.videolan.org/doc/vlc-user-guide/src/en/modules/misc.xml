Compilation Options
</title>

<para>
There are a few options that you can set when
running the configure script, which are not related to modules.
</para>

<para>
You can have a look at these options by typing:
</para>

<screen>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>./configure --help</userinput>
</screen>

<para>
You can for example control all the installation
directories, the system for which you want to build VLC for (if not
guessed correctly),...
</para>

<para>
You can also choose to enable or disable some
optimizations.
</para>

<sect2><title>--disable-plugins</title>

<para>
If you select this option, no plugins will be
enabled. This is definitely not recommended, as you would get a very
poor VLC, and should only be used for testing purposes.
