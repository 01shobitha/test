<h1>The VideoLAN website gets a new home</h1>

<p>
VideoLAN is the software development project behind the open-source
VLC&nbsp;media&nbsp;player (VLC), a cross-platform media player and
streaming solution, some widely used audio/video encoding/decoding
and decryption open-source libraries, and IP network streaming tools.
</p>
<p>
Ever since its inception in 1996 by visionary students, the project has
been hosted on the campus of the &Eacute;cole Centrale Paris (ECP),
a famous French engineering university (&quot;Grande &Eacute;cole&quot;).
The project eventually went open-source in early 2001.
From then on, contributors from all over the world started contributing,
and VLC was ported to Windows within about 3 months.
</p>
<p>
As VLC popularity rose, so did the bandwidth usage of our main web server.
We did upgrade our web server since then (thanks to HP and IBM), and the
campus network connection from 10 to 100&nbsp;Mbps... not enough yet.
</p>
<p>Little did we expect, the request for bandwidth usage
<strong>reduction</strong>! It turns out being the host of a big <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">free software</a> project is
cool, so long as you get the fame, and you have nothing to care about.
</p>
<p>
Given that none of the currently active developers remain involved in
the ECP campus network association, and the obvious lack of interest in
continued support of the VideoLAN project infrastructure from the ECP,
we had no alternative but to put an end to 10&nbsp;years of shared
history.
</p>
<p>
In the perceived interest of our users and contributors, we have hence
decided to leave our historical <em>home</em>. As of now, our main
server will be hosted by French ISP Free S.A.S. which we thank a lot for
its generous offer and its precious help.
