<qandadiv><title>VLC Media Player</title>


<qandaentry><question><para>Where can I download VLC for Mac OS
9?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>Where did you read VLC for Mac OS 9 exist? There is not, and
won't be, a version for Mac OS 9.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>Does VLC support DVDs from all
regions?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>VLC uses <emphasis>libdvdcss</emphasis> to read all DVDs,
disregarding their zone. All regions are supported without any
constraint.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>Where does VLC store its config
file?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>Currently, a config file is created on a per user basis (there
is no global configuration file). If you modify the available options
in VLC and save the new configuration, then a configuration file will
be created in your user directory. The precise location of this file
depends on the Operating System you are running: </para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Unices (Linux, etc.):
<filename>$(HOME)/.vlc/vlcrc</filename></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Mac OS X: <filename>/Library/Preferences/VLC</filename>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Windows: <filename>Application Data\vlc\vlcrc</filename>
(Application Data is usually in <filename>C:\Documents and
Settings\your_name</filename></para></listitem>

<listitem><para>BeOS:
<filename>config/settings/vlcrc</filename></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>VLC has a strange behavior...</para></question>

<answer>

<para>The first thing to do is to delete VLC's configuration
file (see the previous question to know about it's location). Then
restart VLC ; if it doesn't get any better, read the following questions
!</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>I can't read DVDs... !</para></question>

<answer>

<para>Here are a few things to check:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Did you install the libdvdcss package?</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Do you have write access to your DVD device?
For instance, under Unix :</para>

<screen>
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>chmod 666 /dev/dvd</userinput>
</screen>

<para>where <filename>/dev/dvd</filename> is the device corresponding to
your DVD drive.</para>

</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>The video runs but the picture is
distorted</para></question>

<answer>

<para>There is probably a problem with the output layer. There are
several ways of troubleshooting it. First, try with another output
plugin, for instance:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc --vout sdl</userinput>
<prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc --vout x11</userinput>
</screen>

<para>Second, change your screen depth and/or definition. It quite
often helps. Lastly, if running Unix, have a look at your XFree86 video
driver.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>Video is choppy</para></question>

<answer>

<para>Your system is too slow to decode all pictures. It might
be that your CPU basically is not fast enough. It can also be that the
subsystem is misconfigured/misdriven, this happens for example under
Redhat Linux. Here are some elements to improve speed: </para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Turn on DMA on your DVD device, for instance:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Under Linux:</para>

<screen>
<prompt># </prompt><userinput>hdparm -d1 /dev/dvd</userinput>
</screen>

</listitem>

<listitem><para>Under Windows, go to the <emphasis>System</emphasis>
section of the control panel, and go to the <emphasis>Hardware
manager</emphasis> (it is sometimes in a separate tab, and sometimes,
you have to go to the <emphasis>Advanced</emphasis> tab. Then,
righ-click on your DVD player, and check the <emphasis>DMA</emphasis>
checkbox</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Upgrade to the latest driver for your video board</para>

<para>If you are running Linux, you can additionnaly upgrade to the
latest XFree86 version ; if supported, check that the xvideo plug-in is
effectively used with</para>

<screen><prompt>% </prompt><userinput>vlc -vvvv</userinput></screen>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Kill other applications running...</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>Audio and video are out of sync</para></question>

<answer>

<para>This is not normal. Try using another audio output plugin and,
under Unix, kill <emphasis>esd</emphasis> or <emphasis>artsd</emphasis>
if they are running.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>VLC crashes</para></question>

<answer>

<para>Increase the verbosity level (either in the preferences or with a
<emphasis>-vvvv</emphasis> command line option) and look at the debug
messages (in the terminal or in the Messages window).</para>

<para>If you are convinced that it's a bug in VLC, have a look at the
<ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/support/bug-reporting.html">bug
reporting page</ulink>.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>How can I take screenshots?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>To take normal screen capture of the video displayed by VLC
:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>under XFree, add the <emphasis>--vout x11</emphasis>
option to the command line ;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>under Windows, add the <command>--nooverlay</command>
option to the command line.</para></listitem>

<qandadiv><title>VideoLAN streaming solution</title>

<qandaentry><question><para>VLC vs. VLS</para></question>

<answer>

<para>Yes, both programs can be used to stream video, as explained in
the <ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/doc/videolan-howto/">VideoLAN
HOWTO</ulink>. The streaming features of
each program are described on the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/streaming/features.html">streaming
features</ulink> page.</para>

<para>Basically, for the moment:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>VLC is good at streaming various MPEG files in various
encapsulation formats (mpg, vob, mp3, avi, mov, ogg, mp4...) with
a nice graphical interface and is starting to do some transcoding
;</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>VLS is good at streaming DVDs, satellite
channels and digital terrestial TV channels, but cannot do
transcoding.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>In general, VLC has more features, but VLS is more
reliable.</para>

<para>To be a real streamer, VLC would need to be able to read multiple
sources at the same time. VLS can do this since it's origin, but VLC
can't do this for the moment. Some VLC developers are working on a new
version of the VLC input, known as "Input 4", which should address this
issue.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>Isn't it a waste of time to develop both
?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>To understand this situation, you must consider the history of VideoLAN.
Before VLC's stream output, we had two very different programs :</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>VLS, a Linux-only program written in C++, that is
basically a MPEG Transport Stream engine, with a very basic telnet
interface,</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>VLC, a multi-plateform program written in C, that
implements demuxers, codecs, video and audio outputs and graphical
interfaces.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>In september 2002, some VLC developers had the idea of taking
advantage of the multiple demuxers and codecs implemented in VLC
to build a Stream Ouput who's ultimate goal was to be able to do
transcoding. They wrote a stream output for VLC, that was released with
VLC 0.5.0 in late January 2003. VLC's stream output is now beginning to
do some transcoding.</para>

<para>But what is more important is that VLS and VLC developers are not
the same persons ; and that they are free to developer the software they
prefer... ! That's how free software runs, and it has shown in the past
that is was a good engine for innovation and enhancement.</para>

<qandadiv><title>Legal concerns</title>

<qandaentry><question><para>May I use the VideoLAN logo?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>You may freely use the VideoLAN logo using the following
copyright:</para>

<para>
<emphasis>
  Copyright (c) 1996-2002 VideoLAN. This logo or a modified version
  may be used or modified by anyone to refer to the VideoLAN project
  or any product developed by the VideoLAN team, but does not indicate
  endorsement by the project.
</emphasis></para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>May I redistribute a VideoLAN
software?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>You may distribute an original or modified version of a VideoLAN
software as long as you comply with its license terms. It is the GNU
General Public License Version 2 (referred herein as GPL), and it is
in the file named COPYING in our products. The easiest way to conform
to the GPL is to accompany the product you want to distribute with its
sources. For example, if you plan to distribute the lastest binary
version of VLC, you should also include all the files listed on the
<ulink url="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-sources.html">VLC
source code page</ulink>.</para>

<para>You do not need to bother explaining where the sources are, but
the sources have to share the same media as the products. There are
other ways to comply with the GPL, but this should be the simplest
because it does not rely on a contract.</para>

<note><para>You don't need to ask the VideoLAN team the permission to do
so!</para></note>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry><question><para>Is libdvdcss legal?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>The use and distribution of the libdvdcss library is controversial
in a few countries such as the United States because of a law called
the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act). If you are unsure about the
legality of using and distributing this library in your country, please
consult your lawyer.</para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandadiv><title>Miscellaneous</title>

<qandaentry>

<question><para>How may I help your project?</para></question>

<answer><para>You might either contribute time, material,
or money. We are also always needing some translators.
You will find all information you need on the <ulink
url="http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html">contribute page</ulink>.

</para></answer></qandaentry>


<qandaentry><question><para>Why are your mailing-lists and your website in
english?</para></question>

<answer>

<para>VideoLAN's developers come from all around the world and
english is the only language they can use to communicate together.
Although great care is given to the translation of VLC in various
languages, maintaining translations of our documentation and website
costs too much more time than we can afford.</para>
