<para>

your main interface, either start VLC from the command line with
<emphasis>--intf Myinterface</emphasis>, or use the Preferences
Panel to set the <emphasis>Interface Module</emphasis> option. For
Graphical User Interfaces, you might also have shortcuts created by
the install program. If you want the interface to be an additionnal
one, use the preferences window of your GUI to set the <emphasis>extra
interface modules</emphasis> option. Alternatively, you can use the
<emphasis>--extraintf</emphasis> command line option.
