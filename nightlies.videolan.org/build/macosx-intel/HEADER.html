    <h1>VLC media player nightly builds for macOS</h1>
    <p>Remember to test the <strong>latest</strong> nightly build before reporting a bug (in one of the older nightly builds). Have fun!</p>
    <p>Please report nightly builds breakage (meaning that there is no new build) on <code>#videolan</code> on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>.</p>

    <h2>Note: VLC's nightly builds require Mac OS X 10.7 or later</h2>
    <p>It will not launch on older releases. We recommend you to keep your Mac OS X installation up-to-date and to install Apple's updates. This will also improve your VLC usage experience.</p>
    <p>Note that nightly builds for macOS are not signed with our GateKeeper certificate. Therefore, you need to right-click on the application to select <em>Open</em> to launch them for the first time after download.</p>
    <h2>What's the stable branch?</h2>
    <p>That's currently VLC's 2.2 series. We no longer provide nightly builds for VLC 1.1.x, 2.0.x or 2.1.x.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>vlc-<em>version</em>-x86_64</strong> is the latest VLC snapshot compiled in <em>64</em> bit mode.</li>
        <li><strong>VLCKit</strong> is the latest VLC snapshot of the Objective-C framework (libvlc binding) to include VLC's functionality in your own applications.</li>
        <li><strong>VLC-webplugin</strong> is a plugin for web browsers that support NPAPI-style plugins.</li>
