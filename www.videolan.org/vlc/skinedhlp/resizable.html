<h1>How to create a resizable window</h1>
<p>
This documentation aims at helping you understand how VLC decides how to resize a skin and enabling you to create properly resizable skins.
</p>
<h2>How a skin is resized</h2>
<p>
How each element in the skin is resized and repositioned is determine by four attributes.
</p>
<h3>Lefftop and rightbottom</h3>
<p>
When a window has been resized the position and size of each of the elements in the currently displayed layout
is determined by how the edges of the elements are connected to the edges of their parent panel, group or layout.
</p>
<p>
These connections are set by the lefttop and rightbottom attributes of the elements. 
They define to which edge of the parent item the upper left edge and lower right edge move.
The following image illustrates some example connections and how the element is then resized and repositioned when the window is resized.

<b>Examples:</b><br>
So an element which should always stay in the upper left corner of the window must have both the <i>lefttop</i> and <i>rightbottom</i> attribute set to <i>lefttop</i>.
For it to stay always in the upper right corner they accordingly would have to be set to <i>righttop</i>.<br>
If an element should keep its vertical position in the skin, but should change its width according to the width of the window, <i>lefttop</i> has to be set to <i>lefttop</i> and <i>rightbottom</i> to <i>righttop</i>.
</p>
<h3>Keep X and Y ratio</h3>
<p>
The keep x ratio and keep y ratio (<i>called xkeepratio and ykeepratio in the XML</i>) tell VLC whether the width or height of an element should be adjusted when resizing or whether just its position should be changed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b><br>
If you'd want an element to keep its relative horizontal position
you'd have to set <i>lefttop</i> and <i>rightbottom</i> so that the element would be resized according to the change of width.
Additionately you have to set the <i>keep X ratio</i> attribute to <i>true</i>. Then the width of the element will not be changed and it will keep its relative horizontal position in the window.
