<h1> HowTo create your own skin </h1>

<? h2("How does it work"); ?>

<p>First of all you don't need any programming skills. You just need to
know a bit of xml and of course how to create images with an appropriate
software (Microsoft Paint if you're a warrior, the gimp if you are a bit
more serious).</p>

<p>A skin is composed of an XML file and image files. The structure of
the XML file is explained below. The images must be in BMP format.</p>
