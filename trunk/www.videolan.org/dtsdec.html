<h1>dtsdec/libdts - a free DTS Coherent Acoustics decoder</h1>

<p>libdts is a free library for decoding DTS Coherent Acoustics streams. The code is written by <a href="mailto:gbazin@videolan.org">Gildas Bazin</a> and was based on the <a href="http://liba52.sourceforge.net/">a52dec</a> project. It is released under the terms of the GPL license.</p>

<p>The DTS Coherent Acoustics standard (ETSI 102 114 v1.2.1), as published by the ETSI, is available <a href="http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp">here</a> (look for DTS Coherent Acoustics).</p>

<h2>Development status</h2>

<p><span style="color: red;"><b>BIG FAT WARNING: libdts is still in early development stage so don't expect too much of it</b></span></p>

<p>Right now, I am concentrating on finishing the implementation of the core part of the specification. The library should however already be quite useable.</p>

<p>A few things are still lacking there but they should mainly affect low-bitrate DTS streams which don't seem that common anyway (some of the missing things are: Joint channels coding, High frequencies VQ, Dynamic range, etc... - see the TODO file).</p>

<p>There might also be quality issues, but for some early code it does seem pretty decent to me.</p>

<p>None of the extensions (extra channels, 96/192kHz sample rates) have been implemented (and unfortunately the public standard provides only minimal information on them).</p>

<h2>Getting libdts</h2>

<p>Current release is <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/dtsdec/0.0.1/dtsdec-0.0.1.tar.gz">dtsdec-0.0.1.tar.gz</a></p>
