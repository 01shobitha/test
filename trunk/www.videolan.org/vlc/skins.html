<p>VLC has now a skinnable interface. It's only available on Windows
systems and is experimental. That means it should work on Windows 2000
and has not yet been tested on Win9x/WinXP OS.</p>
<p>Actually we are working on a GTK version so that this feature will be
soon available on Linux platforms.</p>

<? h2("How to get it ?"); ?>

<p>You can test the skinnable interface in the <a
href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html">last VLC for
Windows release</a>.</p>

<p>To launch VLC with the skin interface:</p>

<ul>

<li>use the special shortcut in the start menu;</li>

<li>or launch VLC with this command line:

<pre style="margin-left: 50px;">
vlc.exe -I skins
</pre>
</li>

<li>or go to the preference menu after launching VLC and click on
the <b>View/Add Interface/skins</b> menu.</li>

</ul>

<p>You need a skin file too; you can download them from the <a
href="/vlc/download-skins.html">skins download page</a>. These
are just testing skins, but if you think you're some kind of
artist, you don't need any programming skills so here is <a
href="/vlc/skins-create.html">how to create your skin</a>.</p>

<? h2("How to use it ?"); ?>

<p>Not all VLC features are available with skins plugin but here are
what it supports :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Playing a file</li>
  <li>Seeking into a stream</li>
  <li>Sound control</li>
  <li>Playlist</li>
  <li>Key shortcuts</li>
</ul>
