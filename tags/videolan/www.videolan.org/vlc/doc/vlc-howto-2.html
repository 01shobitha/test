<H2><A NAME="s2">2.</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc2">Quick start</A></H2>

<P> This section will help you get, install and use vlc without giving you
much details.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc2.1">Get and install vlc from binary packages</A>
</H2>

<P>The first thing to do is to get an archive, on our web site 
<A HREF="http://www.videolan.org/download.html">http://www.videolan.org/download.html</A></P>
<H3>Which package to chose ?</H3>

<P>There are different packages because vlc has "plugins" which provide 
features but also enlarge the executable and require external libraries. </P>
<P>SDL is a lib which allows you to have an accelerated video output.
You will need libsdl > 1.1.6</P>
<P>If you're using the enlightened sound daemon, you may want to try 
the esd-aware vlc.</P>
<P>Generally, when you don't know what a module name is, you don't 
need/use it :-)</P>
<H3>Debian package</H3>

<P>Just use dpkg :
<PRE>
     dpkg -i vlc-x.x.x.deb
    
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Depending on the package you have downloaded, you may have dependency
problems. You have to solve them, by installing the required libraries.</P>
<H3>RPM package</H3>

<P>Install vlc just as you would install any RPM package : 
<PRE>
     rpm -i vlc-x.x.x.rpm
    
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You may have to install external libraries to meet dependencies, depending on
the package you downloaded (gnome, gtk, esd, ...).</P>
<H3>BeOS users</H3>

<P>Double-click on the archive. It should open your favorite archive extracter.
You can then execute the vlc from there, or extract the archive to a 
directory and run it from there.</P>
<H3>Mac OS X users</H3>

<P>Double-click on the archive, and copy the vlc file to your Applications
folder.</P>
<H3>Windows users</H3>

<P>Launch the installer by double-clicking on it, and follow the installation
instructions. Please note that in most cases you will need administrator
rights to install it under Windows NT, 2000 and XP.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc2.2">Get libdvdcss</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to read CSSsrambled DVDs, you will need libdvdcss. 
You can find binary
packages for your distribution here : 
<A HREF="http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html">http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html</A></P>
<P>For Windows, BeOS and Mac OS X users, libdvdcss is statically linked in the 
Windows binary, so you don't have to install it.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc2.3">Use the vlc for DVD reading</A>
</H2>

<P>Launch the application simply by typing vlc in a terminal (or by 
double-clicking on its icon in a graphical shell). You should see
the graphical interface appear.</P>
<P> 
For reading a DVD (or a VCD), click on the "Disc" button. The new window 
you must then enter the path to your DVD or VCD drive :</P>

<H3>Linux users</H3>

<P>Usually, your dvd device is /dev/hd? (if you have an ide drive).
For instance, if you DVD player is master on the second IDE device,
it will be /dev/hdc.</P>
<P>It is very useful to create a symlink to this file, called /dev/dvd. 
To do this, as root, type (if your dvd device is /dev/hdc for example) :
<PRE>
      ln -s /dev/hdc /dev/dvd
     
</PRE>

Also make sure you have read AND write permission to the device 
(otherwise dvd decryption won't work).</P>
<H3>Windows users</H3>

<P>The path to your DVD drive usually is D:\ or E:\. You may have a look
in "My Computer" and look to which letter your DVD drive is assigned.</P>
<H3>BeOS users</H3>

<P>Under BeOS, the dvd device looks like 
"/dev/disk/ide/atapi/1/slave/0/raw" for example, if your dvd device is 
slave on your first (not sure) ide device.</P>
<H3>Other OS</H3>

<P>To do ...</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="vlc-howto.html#toc2.4">Use the vlc for network streaming</A>
</H2>

<P>This is the vlc original usage. </P>
<P>Launch the vlc as you would have for DVD reading. Then click on the 
"Network" button. </P>
<H3>If using a VideoLAN Channel Server</H3>

<P>The only thing you have to do is to check the "Channel server" box
and to enter the IP address and port 
of this channel
server. Ask your administrator if you don't have it. Then click on OK.</P>
<P>You will see a new "Channel" field in the interface. You may now
enter the selected channel and click on OK. After a few seconds,
if a program is being sent in this channel, you should see the program
start.</P>
<P>If nothing appears and you are sure that a program is streamed in
this channel, you may try once again, because a problem of communication
with the channel server could have occurred (if you launched vlc from
a terminal, you should see "Network error: no answer from vlcs").</P>
<H3>Without VideoLAN Channel Server</H3>

<P>Simply clicking on the network button, then on ok should be 
sufficient in most cases.</P>
<P>After clicking on OK, and if a program is being sent, you should see
a window open with your program.</P>
