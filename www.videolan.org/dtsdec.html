<h1>dtsdec/libdts - a free DTS Coherent Acoustics decoder</h1>

<p>libdts is a free library for decoding DTS Coherent Acoustics streams. The code is written by <a href="mailto:gbazin@videolan.org">Gildas Bazin</a> and was based on the <a href="http://liba52.sourceforge.net/">a52dec</a> project. It is released under the terms of the GPL license.</p>

<p>The DTS Coherent Acoustics standard (ETSI 102 114 v1.2.1), as published by the ETSI, is available <a href="http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp">here</a> (look for DTS Coherent Acoustics).</p>

<h2>Development status</h2>

<p><span style="color: red;"><b>BIG FAT WARNING: libdts is still in early development stage so don't expect too much of it</b></span></p>

<p>Right now, I am concentrating on finishing the implementation of the core part of the specification. The library should however already be quite useable.</p>

<p>A few things are still lacking there but they should mainly affect low-bitrate DTS streams which don't seem that common anyway (some of the missing things are: Joint channels coding, Dynamic range, etc... - see the TODO file).</p>

<p>There might also be quality issues, but for some early code it does seem pretty decent to me.</p>

<p>None of the extensions (extra channels, 96/192kHz sample rates) have been implemented (and unfortunately the public standard provides only minimal information on them).</p>

<h2>Getting libdts</h2>

<p>Current release is <a href="http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdts/0.0.2/libdts-0.0.2.tar.gz">libdts-0.0.2.tar.gz</a></p>

<p><b>Provisional Warning</b>: DTS Inc. claims that use of dtsdec        
software, to decode DTS compressed sound data on a DVD could violate    
DTS's patent rights. If you are unsure about the legality of using      
and distributing this code in your country, in particular in the USA,   
please consult your lawyer before downloading it</p>
