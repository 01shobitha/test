<h1>VLC on MacOS X</h1>

<p> VLC currently only works on Mac OS X 10.1 and later. <b> There is not,
and will never be, a version of VLC for Mac OS 9, so please don't ask ! </b>
</p>

<p> VLC - OS X is distributed as a disk image. Download the .dmg file,
open it, and copy it to your hard drive (for instance the /Applications
folder). Open VLC by double-clicking it. </p>

<p> <b>Hackers wanted !</b> If you feel you can help on the port, don't
hesitate to send us a mail. Please do not send us localized versions of VLC.
The next version will have localization support, through a scheme which
isn't compatible with Apple's, so please don't waste your time... </p>

<h2>Building VLC</h2>

<p> All the building process has to be done from a terminal window. If you
are familiar with Unix, this won't be a problem for you. </p>

<p> After downloading vlc, just type <tt>./configure &amp;&amp; make</tt>
to build the main vlc application. </p>

<p> Starting from VLC 0.2.90, a binary distribution is also available
is the <a href="download.html"> download section</a>. </p>
