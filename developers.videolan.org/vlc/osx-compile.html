<h1>Compile VLC on Mac OS X</h1>

<p>Compiling VLC on Mac OS X is different from normal linux compiling and OS X compiling. We do not use Project Builder to compile, but a simple ./configure and then make isn't enough either. The instructions below are always for the current release.<p>

<p>If you compile from Subversion then please remember that Subversion can often be in an unstable state. If you wish to develop or test please join the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/support/lists.html">vlc-devel mailinglist</a>.<br />
Don't put any of the non released test binaries or svn-compiles on software sites or on userforums. We have had bad experiences with this before and we do not appreciate it.</p>

<p>Please follow these steps for compiling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the Mac OSX developer tools from the Developer Tools CD, or get them <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html">online</a>.</li>
<li>Download the VLC source code (use <a href="/svn.html">subversion</a>).</li>
<li>cd to the source directory with your Terminal application.</li>
<li>If you have fink, then you will need to disable it. VLC has it's own form of Fink (in the extras/contrib subdir) and it can conflict with Fink. We use this system to generate a reliable, consistent and known amount of packages that VLC requires. To disable Fink comment the line:
<code>#source /sw/bin/init.csh</code> in your .cshrc file or
<code>. /sw/bin/init.csh</code> in your .bashrc file in your homedirectory.</li>
<li>cd to the extras/contrib subdir of VLC and execute ./bootstrap</li> 
<li>Now execute <code>make src</code>. This will download and compile all the required external libraries and programs. You will only have to do this once. (You can do it again if required libraries are added or updated by the team)</li>
<li>Now we return to VLC itself. Go back to the top level VLC source directory. If you use Subversion (which you really should), then run <code>./bootstrap</code>. This will create configure and Makefiles for VLC (snapshots and releases already include this).</li>
<li>The next step is to configure. <code>./configure --disable-x11 --disable-xvideo --disable-glx --disable-gtk --disable-sdl --enable-ffmpeg --with-ffmpeg-mp3lame --with-ffmpeg-faac --with-ffmpeg-zlib --enable-mad --enable-libdvbpsi --enable-a52 --disable-dvdplay --enable-dvdnav --enable-faad --enable-vorbis --enable-ogg --enable-theora --enable-faac --enable-mkv --enable-freetype --disable-cddax --disable-vcdx --enable-speex --enable-flac --enable-goom --enable-livedotcom --enable-caca --disable-skins2 --disable-wxwidgets --enable-modplug --enalble-daap --enable-x264 --enable-debug</code> <br />Notice this is ALWAYS for the subversion version. It might not work with older versions.</li>
<li>After configure is finished, we can finally build VLC. a simple <code>make</code> will do the trick.</li>
</ul>
