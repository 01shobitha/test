Modules and options for VLC</title>

<sect1><title>The modules</title>


<para>VLC uses a modular system, which allows to add easily new
fonctions and formats. Here is a description of nearly all the VLC
modules. A few "internal" modules won't be explained here. For a 
complete list of all VLC modules, please have a look at the LIST file
 in the subdirectory "modules" of the VLC source tree.</para>
<para>If you installed VLC through a binary file, you will get
the default modules. If, however, you want to customize VLC to your
needs, you will have to compile VLC from sources.</para>
<para>Reading this part may be useful if you intend to compile VLC or
if you want to know all the options available for modules you use.</para>
<para>The compilation itself is explained in the next chapter.</para>

<emphasis>disabled by default</emphasis>, you have to launch the
