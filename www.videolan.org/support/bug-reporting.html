<h1> Bug reporting </h1>

<p>If you find any bugs, or if you experience any crashes, then we would very much like to hear of these problems/suggestions. To make dealing with these as easy as possible, we as developers would like to see the following of you.
</p>

<h2>Where to report</h2>

<p>First try the <a href="http://forum.videolan.org">forums</a>. Search them and see if someone else has asked this question. If not, post your question or problem in the forum and make sure you include as much information as possible (see also the pointers below). Off course you can also mail us with your problems when you subscribe to the <a href="/support/lists.html">mailinglist</a>.</p>
<p>When the bug has been confirmed it can be entered into our <a href="http://bugzilla.videolan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=VLC">bugzilla</a> bugtracking system.
If you want to keep track of your bug you can create your own personal bugzilla account <a href="http://bugzilla.videolan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/createaccount.cgi">here</a> (preferred). You will then be informed about any changes that are related to this bug.</p>

<p>When you post on the forum or email us, please provide as much information as possible in your report. 
We try to answer all your mails, posts and reports, but there are so many that sometimes we simply don't have the time to do so. Especially the reports in bugzilla entered by guests can be a victim of this. Be assured that we read ALL of them though.
</p>

<h2>What to include in your report</h2>

<p>Please gather the following information and send it along with your report.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are registered on the forum, or that your email has a valid reply address, so we can get back to you with possible additional questions. Reports without contact information or by unregistered users, will not be handled by the team.<br /></li>
<li>Your operating <b>system</b> and the <b>version</b> you use. VLC runs on many systems and this information is really important.<br />
	<i>For instance: WinXP, MacOSX 10.2 or Mandrake 8.1</i></li>
<li>The <b>hardware</b> you use.<br />
        <i>For instance: iMac G4 or Pentium4 with GeForce3</i></li>
<li>The <b>version</b> of VLC you use.<br />
	<i>For instance: VLC 0.7.0 (You should always use the latest version of course)</i></li>
<li>The exact <b>situation</b> in which the problem occurred. Please describe in as much detail as possible.<br />
	<i>For instance: I pressed the play button while fast-forwarding and VLC crashed.</i></li>
<li>Can you always <b>reproduce</b> the problem in a certain way?<br />
	<i>For instance: The crash always occurs with the 'Matrix' DVD after 10 minutes.</i></li>
<li>The type of <b>movie</b> you were playing.<br />
	<i>For instance: DVD, Divx or mpeg.</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional remarks</h2>

<p>If you can, or if it applies to you try to take into account the following.</p>

<h3>Everyone</h3>

<ul>

<li>Try to make sure the problem you are reporting is not already
known, or maybe even already solved. Sources of information include the <a href="
http://forum.videolan.org">Forums</a>, <a
href="http://bugzilla.videolan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/query.cgi">Bugzilla</a>,
the mailing-list <a
href="http://www.via.ecp.fr/via/ml/videolan.html">archives</a>
and your old friend <a href="http://www.google.nl">Google</a>.</li>

<li>Be sure to be using a recent version. Bug reports against old versions of vlc are likely to be ignored, because changes in the program may make it impossible to reproduce the bug, or may even have fixed it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mac OS X users</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please send along the last part of ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/VLC.crash.log if you can. Many crashes of VLC are logged in this file. You can open the file from VLC by going to the menu Window and choosing Messages. Now click the "Open CrashLog" button.<br />
Please make sure you send the last crash (at the bottom of the file) and that it actually is the crash you described. The Date/Time field reports the time of the crash so that way you can check if it is the crash you experienced, or an earlier one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux users</h3>
<ul>
<li>In case of a crash try to include a backtrace (if you know how to).</li>
<li>Your CPU (Pentium 3, Sparc, PowerPC, ...).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Users of VideoLAN products other than VLC</h3>
<ul>
<li>Replace all occurrences of VLC with your productname.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compile problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have read the developer <a href="http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/">documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Give the full log showing the problem
<blockquote>
  <p>
  ./configure &lt;options&gt; &gt; logfile.txt 2&gt;&amp;1 <br />
  make 2&gt;&amp;1 > logfile.txt 2&gt;&amp;1
  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>When dealing with a ./configure issue, please provide the generated config.log file.</li>
<li>Your compiler brand and version may be relevant here as well.</li>
</ul>
