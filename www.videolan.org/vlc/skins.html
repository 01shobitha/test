<h1> Skins </h1>

<h2>Skins VS skins2</h2>

<p><span style="color: red;"><b>Important note:</b></span><br> VLC currently
has two different skins modules, named <i>skins</i> and <i>skins2</i>, the
latter being a complete rewrite of the former. We consider that the
<i>skins</i> module is deprecated, and we strongly encourage people to use
<i>skins2</i> when creating a new skin. The <i>skins</i> module is only kept
because there are still very few skins ported to the new <i>skins2</i> module,
but it is going to disappear one day or other...</p>


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here is a short overview of the main features provided by the skins2
interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Portability: skins work on Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP, and any X11-based OS like Linux</li>
  <li>Ability to load a skin dynamically</li>
  <li>Many predefined controls (button, slider, playlist, etc...)</li>
  <li>Same dialog boxes as the wxWidgets interface</li>
  <li>Resizable windows</li>
  <li>Support for different layouts</li>
  <li>Windows anchoring</li>
  <li>Hotkeys support</li>
  <li>Embedded video output (still experimental)</li>
  <li>And much more...</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to use skins?</h2>

<p>To launch VLC with the <i>skins2</i> interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and install the <a href="/vlc/">latest VLC version</a></li>

  <li>(X11 users) Launch VLC with the following command-line:
  <tt>vlc -I skins2</tt><br>
  (or, for the old <i>skins</i> module: <tt>vlc -I skins</tt>)</li>

  <li>(Windows users) Launch VLC using the appropriate shortcut in the Start
  menu. You can also start VLC from command-line, in a DOS window.</li>

  <li>If you don't want to use the default skin, just download another one on
  the <a href="/vlc/download-skins.html">skins download page</a></li>

  <li>Once VLC is started with the <i>skins2</i> interface (or with the
  <i>skins</i> one), you can use the CTRL+S shortcut to load the new one.
  Enjoy!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Making your own skin</h2>

<p>If you think you have the artistic fiber, feel free to <a
    href="/vlc/skins2-create.html">create your own skin</a>, it does not
require any programming skill. We will be glad to add your skin to add your new
skin to the website!</p>
